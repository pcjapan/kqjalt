:::Task complexity and second language development: tools to promote speaking|12/04/2011 18:17:06|/chapters/kq/schedule/2012/may/12|05/12/2012 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Colin Thompson|This presentation discusses the role of task complexity for developing L2 speaking skills in terms of fluency, accuracy and complexity. The presenter will begin by reviewing the theoretical background of task-based learning, its advantages and disadvantages before focusing on the role of task complexity, and how tasks can be designed and sequenced to promote learners’ L2 speech, referencing Robinson’s (2003) Cognition Hypothesis as a framework. The talk is supported with quantitative and qualitative data which investigates the impact of task complexity for developing Japanese learners’ L2 speaking skills at the University level.****Colin Thompson is a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire, UK. I’ve been teaching in Japan for five years and my research interests are task-based language learning and teaching.****

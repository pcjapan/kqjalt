The purpose of this presentation is to introduce this career path and make it more transparent for passionate educators who are interested in teaching at the university level. This informative session will provide concrete suggestions on the preparations and procedures applicants should consider taking to help with their chances. Realistic expectations about the logistics and the nature of the job will also be set as the presenter provides examples of responsibilities at such positions. Different levels of positions and potential career paths at university teaching will also be explored. A short Q&A with the attendees is planned at the end of the session. ****Jackson Lee is a Specially-Appointed Lecturer at Toyo University in Tokyo.

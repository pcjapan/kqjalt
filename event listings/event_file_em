:::Active Participation through Student Response|11/26/2010 00:20:09|/chapters/kq/schedule/2011/february/12|02/12/2011 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Bill Pellowe and Paul Shimizu| We can motivate students to stay focused in the classroom through student response systems (SRS) that require all students to respond simultaneously. Low-tech SRS include giving students batsu-maru****paddles to show the teacher. In more complex SRS, students use remote clickers to send in answers. Regardless of the level of technology, SRS improve student concentration, and encourage an active engagement with the material.  ****In this presentation, first, Paul Shimizu and Bill Pellowe will  demonstrate a low-tech student response system they've developed using simple, 2-sided answer paddles. More information about this can be found at http://captur.me website, which contains downloadables and activity ideas.****Next, Bill Pellowe will demonstrate a high-tech response system that he developed. This free, open-source system is available for download from http://moars.com, and with it, teachers can easily create web-based quizzes and surveys for students to take on mobile devices such as iPod Touch, mobile phones, etc.  Feel free to bring your iPhone or iPod Touch.****

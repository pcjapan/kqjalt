There will be a number of presenters who will each take turns presenting their chosen topic using only 20 slides for 20 seconds per slide. This creative event promises to be a rewarding experience for all involved where people can have fun sharing ideas and thoughts about their classroom experiences and research.****The presenters we have lined up to date are:****Juha Vaittinen****Jason McDonald****Roderick van Huis****Zack Robertson****These presentations are a great way to get your feet wet and try out some new ideas as well as a ton of fun. There is still space for more presentations, so, if anyone is interested, please contact us. Of course, you don't have to present to come, so we hope to see a good turnout.****

This month we have a couple of activities guaranteed to bring some seasonal cheer into the classroom, as well as help your students gain a better understanding of the whole Christmas experience.****Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean****Find all the Christmas iconography in the short video Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean. Determine which icons are religious and which are secular. Create a narration and dialogue for the silent film.************Christopher Carman teaches full-time at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health and part-time at the University of Kitakyushu.********Illustrated Christmas Carol Titles******** Match the punny illustrations with the names of traditional and offbeat Christmas songs.

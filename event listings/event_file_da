Although very Apple-specific, the concepts demonstrated can be applied to almost any platform.****“Keynote in the Classroom”****Steve Paton****Using presentation software, like Keynote, in your lessons can help to make them more engaging and interesting for your students, and more fun, productive, and efficient for you. This presentation will cover the basics of Keynote; getting started with templates, simple builds and animations using text and images, cool transitions, and a few very special effects that you just can’t get from chalk on a blackboard!****“Creating Content with iBooks Author”****Malcolm Swanson****iBooks Author is an application for creating learning content for delivery on iOS devices. Like all Apple software, it is easy to use, addictive, and capable of doing amazing things once users master the basics. The software's basic workflow will be shown, followed by a demonstration of some of the more advanced features, and how it can be used by students to create their own content.****

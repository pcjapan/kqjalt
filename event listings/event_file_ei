It is a philosophy that says our dependence on materials and technology can actually slow down the learning process. It is also an approach to teaching that is materials light, conversation-driven, and focuses on emergent language.****More importantly, what does Dogme in English Language Teaching have to offer English teachers in Japan? This workshop will focus on answering this question. Using a Dogme approach, we'll uncover the principles that characterize Dogme ELT, how these principles might work in unplugging our own teaching.****Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto has been an EFL teacher and teacher trainer since 1985. She has conducted workshops throughout Asia, the U.S. and Latin America, and is co-author of Let's Go (OUP).

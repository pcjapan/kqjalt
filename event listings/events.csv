:::Chapter AGM / Lightning Sessions - Focus on Classroom Practice|10/26/2023 16:06:03|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/november/11|11/11/2023 - 18:00 to 20:00|2023||Various Chapter Officers, Hudson Murrell, Markus Yong|This month's meeting will be divided into two parts. First, we will hold the chapter Annual General Meeting (AGM). Officer reports will be tabled, and we will elect our officers for 2024.****Following this this will be our Lightning Session presentations on the theme of Focus on Classroom Practices.****Hudson Murrell****Small Group Discussion on DIM (Digital Instructional Materials) Homework****Students are required to do as homework a listening activity of their choice. I have set up a blog with links to such sites as ELLLO, BreakingNewsEnglish, and Ted Talks. For the weekly homework activities, students need to access one of these sites, choose something to listen to, and then fill out a simple online journal to record what they worked on. Three times during the semester they are required to fill out a My Top 5 sheet of homework they have done, and bring this to class. They discuss this in small groups. I will outline multiple ways in which this discussion is effective for the students' learning.****Hudson Murrell is a professor at Sanyo Onoda City University in Yamaguchi. His research interests are in gamification, increasing speaking output and extensive reading.****Markus Yong****An AI-based Extensive Reading Program****In the first semester of 2023, my students participated in a weekly extensive reading program whereby they created and read their own stories via ChatGPT. This presentation will provide preliminary results from this experimental program.****Markus Yong has been teaching English in Japan for 17 years, and currently works at Kyushu Kyouritsu University.****Each presenter will have 15 minutes to share their ideas.****After the presentations, there will be time for questions and discussion. Participants will also be encouraged to briefly share other ideas they may have related to classroom practices.****

:::Bringing ChatGPT into the Language Classroom: Getting a Piece of the AI Pie in the Sky|04/06/2023 13:16:46|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/june/17|06/17/2023 - 18:00 to 20:00|2023||Steve McGuire|****Link to the presentation slideshow: https://tinyurl.com/2023McGKita3********The presentation is an extension of two previous presentations. The focus of this presentation is to explore the practical application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in language instruction, specifically using ChatGPT and other applications.************During the presentation, we will discuss a planned collaboration between the English teachers at Nagoya University of Arts. This collaboration will involve creating supplemental follow-up activities based on the language and text of each unit of our chosen textbook. We will also explore ideas for meeting individual students' ability levels, needs, and interests.************Many teachers are concerned that students can use AI to complete traditional classroom tasks without actually learning the material. Therefore, we will emphasize creative and critical thinking, live interaction, and real-time performance to avoid overreliance on AI and encourage students to demonstrate their learning.************Furthermore, we will discuss how AI can save teachers time and effort by creating lesson plans and individualized assessments, including Google Forms-formatted quizzes and feedback on student essays. We will also share some available tools and resources and explore the near future of AI in language education.************Join us as we delve into the exciting world of AI and its potential in language education. Let's get a piece of our AI pie!************Steve McGuire is a Professor at Nagoya University of the Arts who is interested in cooperative learning, vocabulary, qualitative and quantitative research, and CALL. He has been teaching with, and writing about computers for education since 1989 and posting and presenting about ChatGPT since it came out in November of 2022.********For this presentation, Steve will be joining us online at our venue in Kokura.

:::Lightning Sessions: Focus on Classroom Practices|04/06/2023 12:46:43|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/july/08|07/08/2023 - 18:00 to 19:00|2023||Steven Apotheker, Markus Yong, Andrew Zitzmann|Unfortunately, due to the uncertain weather conditions, it has been decided to cancel this evening's meeting. We will try and reschedule for later in the year.****For our July meeting we will be holding a number of short (15-minute) presentations with a focus on classroom practices. The lineup is as follows:****Using Total Physical Response in the College Classroom****Steven Apotheker - Seinan Gakuin University****Total Physical Response (TPR) in foreign language education is considered to be best suited for beginners. While games like Simon Says or Touch are simple ways to teach action verbs or vocabulary for objects found around the classroom, TPR is rarely used beyond the beginner level. This presentation will introduce three ways that TPR can be used to provide hints to intermediate students to help them self-correct common mistakes and omissions. I will demonstrate the hand gestures that I use for pronouns and be-verbs, prepositions of place, and common mistakes such as omitted articles and particles.****Steven Apotheker is an Assistant Professor at Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka, Japan. He graduated with an MA from Kyushu University and the University of Michigan.****Report on PanSIG Kyoto****Markus Yong - Kyushu Kyoritsu University****In this presentation I will provide an overview of what I'd learnt from attending several presentations during the PanSIG conference held on the 13th of May. This will then be followed by a discussion of how these insights could be applied to the classroom.****Markus Yong has been teaching English in Japan since 2006. He started as an ALT and has taught at a number of universities in the Kitakyushu region including Kyushu Kyoritsu University where he is currently full-time. His research interests have involved gamification, task based language learning, international cultural exchanges and AI assisted language learning.****Increasing Student Interaction in an EFL Classroom****Andrew Zitzmann - Seinan Jo Gakuin University****A common challenge in the language classroom is getting students to interact with each other. This presentation will initially examine some of the transitional causes for poor student interaction and look at the benefits of increased interaction for both the student and the teacher. It will also offer some practical and easy-to-apply solutions that will make the class more active and effective.****Andrew Zitzmann has been teaching in the Kitakyushu area since 1992. His interests are in student satisfaction and educational transitions.********We are currently planning to hold our summer social event after the presentations, so please check back for more details closer to the date.****
:::2030 SDGs game – An invitation to explore our world and yourself –  / 「2030 SDGs ゲーム」～世界と自分を探求する体験～|03/12/2023 09:59:43|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/may/20|05/20/2023 - 18:00 to 20:00|2023||網岡健司  Kenji Amioka| The 2030 SDGs is a card-based game where you can experience the journey to 2030 in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.****This game is not for studying the SDGs. It gives people a direct experience of participating in co-creating a sustainable world (“I can do it”; “what I do makes a difference.”) Therefore, even those who have never heard of the word SDGs or who are not very interested in it can become enthusiastic and enjoy themselves while understanding the essence of the SDGs.****「2030 SDGs」は、持続可能な開発目標を達成するための2030 年までの旅を体験できるカードゲームです。****このゲームはSDGsを勉強するためのものではありません。持続可能な世界の共創に参加する直接的な体験を人々に提供します (「私にはできる」、「私の行動が違いを生み出す」)。****そのため、SDGsという言葉を聞いたことがない人や、あまり興味のない人でも、SDGsの本質を理解しながら、夢中になって楽しむことができます。****Kenji Amioka is a specialist and an activist who has been involved in planning and producing sustainable urban development projects in Kitakyushu City for over 30 years.

:::Maximising the Potential of Machine Translation: A Workshop for Language Educators |02/14/2023 21:41:05|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/april/08|04/08/2023 - 18:00 to 20:00|2023||Louise Ohashi|AI technology is making rapid gains and its impact on language teaching and learning is about to reach new heights. Widespread accessibility to highly developed machine translation tools can be problematic when students simply want to avoid doing coursework, but they are powerful learning aids when used in meaningful ways. Furthermore, while translation accuracy in the newly-released chatbot ChatGPT is still poor, it can already provide useful examples at different levels of formality and offer useful explanations. Its accuracy will increase rapidly as data from millions of daily users helps it improve though deep learning. In this workshop, participants will discuss and try different ways they can guide students to develop their L2 skills with DeepL, GoogleTranslate and ChatGPT, both through in class activities and for self-study.****Associate Professor Louise Ohashi (Gakushuin University, Japan) specializes in SLA and language education. Her main research interests are learner autonomy, motivation, and language learning/teaching with technology.

:::Narrative Inquiry into Language Teacher Identity: ALTs in the JET Program|12/03/2022 14:53:25|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/march/11|03/11/2023 - 18:15 to 19:45|2023||Takaaki Hiratsuka|For over three decades, hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals have set foot on Japanese soil as foreign assistant language teachers (ALTs) through the government-sponsored Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) program. The job of the ALTs is to teach English in elementary and secondary schools, in tandem with Japanese teachers of English (JTEs). Although there is an apparent need for scrutiny of the lived experiences of ALTs in their situated contexts, empirical discussion and research addressing them have been remarkably insufficient. Against this backdrop, the study on which this presentation is based explored, via narrative interviews, the identities and their constructions of 25 ALTs in the JET program. It is of critical importance to understand the complexities of ALT identity because how we view ourselves, how we project ourselves to others, and how others perceive us impact all aspects of our professional and private lives, including our beliefs, emotions, development, and practices. The findings revealed that the gestalt of ALT identity is comprised of two primary categories, foreigner identity and dabbler identity, and their six incumbent sub-identities (i.e., celebrity, sojourner, English expert, assistant, greenhorn, and Japanese novice). The presentation concludes with implications for language teacher education and identity research.****Takaaki Hiratsuka is an associate professor at Ryukoku University in Kyoto, Japan, where he teaches a range of applied linguistics courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. He currently supervises master’s and PhD students in related fields of language teacher education and narrative inquiry. He received his PhD from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. His recent book publications include: Narrative inquiry into language teacher identity: ALTs in the JET program (2022, Routledge) and Team teachers in Japan: Beliefs, identities, and emotions (in press, Routledge).  ****Note: This meeting will be in our regular venue in Kitakyushu. In keeping with our chapter policy, and dependant on the COVID situation, attendees may be required to wear a mask whilst at the presentation.****Doors open at 6pm, the presentation will start around 6:15pm.****Attendance is free for JALT members, 1,000 yen at the door for nonmembers.****
:::Practical Approaches to Making Impactful Presentations|12/03/2022 14:38:07|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/february/11|02/11/2023 - 18:15 to 19:45|2023||Jackson Koon Yat Lee|After a year of presentations, events, and conferences, now is a great time to reflect on your presentation styles and approaches. What are your ways to capture your audience’s attention? Are you using your slides efficiently? How do you end your talks memorably?****In this session, the speaker will introduce and demonstrate essential skills and approaches that can be applied immediately to improve presentations of a variety of levels and settings. Together, we will explore multiple ways to introduce and conclude a talk, as well as become more aware of common downfalls some speakers habitually find themselves attached to. Overall, this session will help you be able to share your ideas and connect with the audience in more effective and impactful ways. The elements discussed will also be applicable to students who are learning about foundational presentation skills.

:::More Personal Finance in Japan|12/03/2022 13:12:09|/chapters/kq/schedule/2023/january/21|01/21/2023 - 18:15 to 19:45|2023||Ben Shearon|****As space is limited at the presentation venue, please preregister your attendance: https://forms.gle/i5TXresTijqa7rvg6 ********Personal finance is the cornerstone of a comfortable life. If you have good money habits and knowledge you will be able to enjoy your life and spend your time doing interesting and productive things. If you have bad money habits and knowledge you will probably not enjoy your life and will spend a lot of time worrying about money. ****This session will go through a rapid-fire series of practical personal finance principles and tips for residents of Japan, followed by a question and answer discussion session. This is a new workshop format so should be useful even if you have attended a RetireJapan seminar before. Come with questions, leave with new ideas and answers.****Ben Shearon (Tanaka) was a university lecturer in Sendai (he retired from formal work in March 2022).

:::Getting More Out of Peer Feedback|10/15/2022 11:56:42|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/november/05|11/05/2022 - 18:15 to 19:45|2022||Zack Robertson|********Peer feedback activities (also known as “peer assessment” or “peer review”) are popular among teachers for facilitating student interaction and task engagement while simultaneously offering students formative assessment opportunities. When implemented properly, they can encourage synthesis of target material as learners attend to specific aspects of quality criterion, as well as deeper processing that has been linked with metacognitive development such as self-regulation, awareness, and evaluative expertise. Additionally, the cooperative aspects of peer feedback have been linked to increased learner enjoyment, resulting in lowered affective resistance toward communicating in the L2.************Many instructors, however, struggle to find ways to effectively conduct these activities while balancing the myriad of competing demands their job entails. This presentation will provide attendees with a review of the theoretical underpinnings of peer feedback, an examination of environmental factors that influence peer feedback efficacy, and an overview of an exploratory study conducted by the presenter into what learners actually take away from the activity. A set of basic guidelines will then be introduced that teachers can use to adapt peer feedback activities to better align with their respective teaching contexts. The presentation will conclude by offering attendees the chance to ask questions or share their own ideas/experiences concerning peer feedback activities.************Zack Robertson has been teaching English in the Kitakyushu area for over 17 years, starting in elementary schools as a member of the JET Program before moving to the university level where he has taught at several universities in the Fukuoka/Yamaguchi area. His research interests include peer feedback and English for Academic Purposes.

:::A 2-Part Workshop on Critical Thinking and Reflective Practices|09/01/2022 11:52:26|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/october/15|10/15/2022 - 17:30 to 20:00|2022||Andrew Boon|********For our October meeting, Andrew Boon will be covering two separate topics. We hope you can join us for one or both.********Designing critical thinking activities for the classroom********In the first presentation, I will  outline Hadley & Boon's (2023) cyclical process to introduce critical thinking  into the language classroom. This involves the learners becoming better critical thinkers via raising awareness of their individual beliefs and biases, listening to or reading carefully the information they receive, and considering potential weaknesses within the arguments. It also explains how I designed a series of activities to orient learners to the critical thinking process and to introduce them to various logical fallacies that may be used to mislead listeners or readers. Participants will be introduced to several of these critical thinking activities. They will be encouraged to adapt them or design original activities for their own particular teaching context.********Facilitating reflective practice online********In the second presentation, I will describe how teachers may make use of the Cooperative Development (CD) (Edge, 2002) or Instant Messenger Cooperative Development (IMCD) (Boon 2005, 2007, 2015, 2019) framework to interact together within a virtual non-judgmental environment to reflect on and investigate pedagogic puzzles, to make discoveries about our teaching, and to determine plans of action of how best to proceed in our classes. Participants will also be encouraged to undertake their own short CD/IMCD sessions regarding their teaching and to reflect on their experiences of using the framework.************Andrew Boon is a Professor in the faculty of Global Communications at Toyo Gakuen University, Tokyo, Japan. He has been teaching in Japan for over 25 years and holds a PhD from Aston University. His research focuses on learner support and discovery in non-judgmental environments. He has presented at numerous conferences, written coursebooks and graded readers, and has published articles on teacher development, motivation, and methodology. His is also the co-author of  the forthcoming title, Critical Thinking ('Research and Resources in Language Teaching' series, Routledge).********Note********Each presentation will run for approximately 1 hour with a 30-minute break in between.****This session will be held online.

:::Lesson Planning: The Key to Effective Teaching|08/23/2022 11:41:21|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/september/10|09/10/2022 - 18:15 to 19:45|2022||Fiona Myers Kanemura|********A lesson plan is an essential instrument that serves as a guide, a resource, and a document that reflects the teaching philosophy and, most importantly, the learning objectives of a lesson. It reflects a teacher's beliefs, understanding of, and orientation towards the curriculum, subject, learners, and pedagogy. Hernandez (2007) opines that when English teachers plan their lessons, they also have to take into account several variables to make sure that their lessons are going to be effective. (p.1). These variables include the learner's background, interest, class size, and linguistic competence.************Effective teaching, good class management, and sustained educational advancement depend on fruitful lesson planning. In addition, lesson planning helps teachers with the smooth delivery of the content. At its heart, teaching involves being able to unpack something one knows well to make it accessible to and learnable by someone else, and this can only be done with effective lesson planning. This requires explicit knowledge and skill beyond simple expertise. Being accomplished in a specific domain does not automatically include the capacity to break knowledge of the domain into its core components and transmit this to someone who lacks skill or understanding in said domain. Therefore, EFL instructors must effectively use the time to prepare for the learners, ultimately providing rewarding learning experiences in each lesson.************This presentation is centered around discussing the effectiveness of lesson planning. Areas to be covered include:********Planning engaging lessons to facilitate learning and implement appropriate teaching strategies and resources,****organization and time management,****assessment techniques that can be used to evaluate the learners before and during the lesson.************During this professional learning session, participants will have an opportunity to collaborate——an essential aspect of teaching, learn new teaching strategies, discuss, share their best practices and ask questions.************Fiona Kanemura has been teaching in a variety of contexts for the past 17 years. Before teaching in Japan, she was a high school literacy specialist and social studies teacher.  She currently teaches English at Kyushu International University and Shimonoseki City University, and is a doctoral student at Concordia University Chicago. She has a teaching diploma, BED, and an MA. Her areas of interest are curriculum design, teaching methodologies, and motivation.********Reference********Hernández, M.S. (2007).

:::An online application for advancing quantitative data analysis|06/11/2022 18:58:32|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/july/16|07/16/2022 - 18:00 to 19:30|2022||Paul Collett|****For quantitative research into foreign language learning or teaching, the dominant approach is arguably inferential statistics for statistical significance testing. Here, a test statistic (p-value) is calculated from sampled data, and decisions on the variables being tested-whether to accept or reject them as in some way contributing to the processes under study-are made based on the calculated p-value. However, this approach has long been recognised by numerous methodologists and theorists as potentially flawed, possibly holding back much research from contributing to substantive theory creation. Alternative measures are recommended; if not rejecting the approach outright, it is suggested that the results of statistical significance tests are augmented with measures of effect size, confidence intervals, robust variations of inferential statistics, and data-rich graphical plots. This presentation introduces an online application designed to help researchers carry out quantitative analysis focused on these alternatives to significance testing. Aimed particularly at less-experienced researchers, it requires little more than the input of data for the output of a range of useful statistics and plots. The rationale behind and usage of the application will be covered.****Paul Collett works at Shimonoseki City University. His interests include research methodology and epistemology, and working towards better practices in these areas. ****For this presentation, we'll be back to face-to-face meetings.

:::Shifting from ALT or eikaiwa jobs to university teaching|03/22/2022 14:40:02|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/june/12|06/12/2022 - 17:00 to 18:30|2022||Jackson Koon Yat Lee|****Some ALTs and eikaiwa teachers in Japan often find themselves limited in career choices within their teaching environments, while the option to shift to university teaching seems to have an intimidatingly high barrier to entry. The purpose of this presentation is to introduce this career path and make it more transparent for passionate educators who are interested in teaching at the university level. This informative session will provide concrete suggestions on the preparations and procedures applicants should consider taking to help with their chances. Realistic expectations about the logistics and the nature of the job will also be set as the presenter provides examples of responsibilities at such positions. Different levels of positions and potential career paths at university teaching will also be explored. A short Q&A with the attendees is planned at the end of the session. ****Jackson Lee is a Specially-Appointed Lecturer at Toyo University in Tokyo.

:::Online learning from a student’s perspective|03/01/2022 13:21:45|/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/may/14|05/14/2022 - 17:30 to 19:00|2022||Miguel Mision|****After two years of the pandemic, it is still difficult to say what a ‘normal’ classroom will be like anymore. What important lessons were learnt in these past two years, and are there benefits to online learning beyond virus prevention? The author examined perspectives and experiences on what it was like learning remotely as a university student over the course of two years. Surveys and one on one interviews were conducted on a target demographic of students. The research had surprisingly mixed results both positive and negative. Students were asked which style of learning they preferred – online, face-to-face or a blend of both. Curiously, there was a three-way split between all options in the first year. In the second year, a majority favored online or blended learning. Although many students and teachers are quick to assume that face-to-face learning allows young people to enjoy a more “normal” university life – the results indicate that there are cases where the merits of online learning exceed those of face-to-face classes. ****Miguel Mision did his undergraduate in engineering and international studies with a major in Japanese at the University of Technology, Sydney. Once upon a time he was an engineer and worked for Toshiba Corp in Australia. He came to Japan in 2009 and worked as an ALT teaching all levels from kindergarten to highschool to corporate. Miguel has an MA in Education majoring in TESOL with the University of Wollongong. His research interests include both Computer and Mobile Assisted Language Learning and Student Well-Being.****This event will be held online.

Moreover, many young adults lack confidence and a voice, often detached from issues in Japanese society. Are our traditional approaches to English language instruction preparing our learners to become active and global participants of the “Experience Age”?****The presenter hopes to inspire foreign language teachers through a one-year, hybrid, cross-cultural (Nepal-Japan) SDG program. The framework can be implemented in any secondary school to involve our learners to become autonomous thinkers in an ever-evolving, multilingual world.****Namiko Tsuruta has taught for 23 years in Kanto and trained Japanese teachers and ALTs in schools for many years.

:::Teaching Younger Learners: Ideas and Information|02/22/2021 02:24:24|/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/march/13|03/13/2021 - 17:30 to 19:30|2021||Chelanna White, Mark Fennelly|For our March meeting, we will have two sessions focussing on teaching younger learners. Our first session with Chelanna White will begin at 5:30 pm and run until 6:10 pm. After a short break, our second speaker Mark Fennelly will talk from 6:15 pm onwards.****Online: Zoom****https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84894142078?pwd=K2tLV2lFVW5CUjNPSDJSNVNUbGdydz09****Meeting ID: 848 9414 2078****Passcode: 198905********Chelanna White****Two Activities for High School Classes************Activity 1 - After attending a talk by Dr. Krashen and Dr. Mason hosted by Kobe JALT in 2019, I became interested in the Story Listening method for teaching and reinforcing vocabulary, and decided to try it out with the English club at two senior high schools in Kyoto. I have also used this method in full classes. I will introduce the Story Listening method and share my experiences in implementing it.************Activity 2 - I took the classic foreign language activity of using a simple map to show how to give directions, and gave it a Pokémon-themed spin. Using maps created for an unofficial role playing game based on the Pokémon franchise made the content more fun and relatable for the students (and me!). I share the resources I used to make the lesson, how I interpreted the map exercise, and a fun closing activity.************Chelanna White is a 4th-year ALT with the JET Programme and the Prefectural Advisor for Kyoto. She teaches primarily first year senior high school students. She is also the Co-Chair of Programming for the Kyoto JALT chapter.************Mark Fennelly****Understanding and Applying the New Course of Study at Elementary School************Since the early 1990s the government has been implementing English at the elementary school level. From 2020 the new course of study for elementary school was introduced with foreign language activities required at the third and fourth grade and English being taught as a subject in the fifth and sixth grades. This change will be followed by the introductions of the new course of study and subsequent textbooks at junior high in 2021 and senior high in 2022. This presentation will offer background into the implementation of the new Course of Study and its implications at the classroom level. As a member of the committee which produced the course of study, the committee which developed the materials based on the course of study, and textbook development, the speaker hopes to offer insight into d the main aspects if the New Course of Study and offer concrete ideas, based on classroom research at research and local schools and textbook research, to identify how school English classes need to change in the future to follow the government outlines. A large change in teaching style and evaluation is expected throughout the school system.************Mark Fennelly is a professor at Shikoku University. He has 30 years teaching experience in Japan, with 13 years in elementary and junior school, and 17 years involved in teacher development at the university level.

:::Building an Effective, Free Language Lab|01/15/2021 15:24:57|/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/february/13|02/13/2021 - 17:00 to 18:30|2021||Erin Noxon|********Speaking practice, listening to different speakers, answering questions... All things you would love for your students to be able do in the language lab. But, do you have the time, the budget, and can you find the right software? What if you could do it all for free, with equipment that you already have lying around, and, after the initial set up time, the class took care of itself? Over the past years I've created my own curriculum out of spare parts, using G Suite tools for voice recognition, forms-based grading, Elllo.org, and more. I'll teach you how to do it and share all of my materials with you.************Dr. Erin Noxon is a Google Certified Innovator and teaches at Sagano High School in Kyoto, Japan.

:::My Share - Ideas That Work|11/05/2020 18:19:39|/chapters/kq/schedule/2020/november/14|11/14/2020 - 19:00 to 20:30|2020||Roger Ferrari, Sophie Otsuru, Ben Rentler, Malcolm Swanson|****We all have ideas that help make our classes better for us and our students. Come and hear about some activities and approaches that our speakers have found useful in their teaching.****This session will be presented live over Zoom..************Roger Ferrari: Non-Verbal Cues in the Classroom**** Classroom lessons follow a structure as set out by the teacher in accordance with their lesson plan. An average class may drift between periods of teacher instruction, peer-to-peer practice, free group practice and so on. While we may use the voice for instruction and direction using non-verbal cues to, for example, start and stop activities can be an efficient tool in the classroom. This presentation looks at various non-verbal audio and visual cues that can be used in the classroom which can be applicable for classes across a wide range of size, level and age.****Roger Ferrari is a teacher at Fukuoka University Wakaba High School. He has been teaching in Japan and London since 2006. He recently presented at PanSIG on the use of etymology in the English classroom.********************Sophie Otsuru: Pictures as Speaking Prompts for Tests ****To assess speaking skills many options are available: roleplay, individual or group presentations, flashcards or picture description. In this presentation I will argue in favour of the final option: using pictures as speaking prompts. Because picture description tasks represent a real challenge for students who need a framework to display the extent of their language capacities and show some fluency, I will suggest an ideal framework that has worked particularly well for the Pearson Progress Test. The second part of the presentation will offer participants time to do the task themselves, record their performance, assess it, and discuss their performance in small groups. I will conclude with descriptors for 2 levels:  CEFR A2/B1 and B2.****Sophie Otsuru has been teaching English for Academic Purposes for almost 10 years. Her research interests range from psycholinguistics to assessments.********************Ben Rentler:  Facilitating Interactive Learning Online with Nearpod ****The coronavirus has caused many universities around the world to hold classes online and teachers have been struggling to make the transition from face-to-face to online. In my presentation, I will showcase the online lesson tool known as Nearpod. The presentation will offer some solutions on how to make online classes interactive. Specifically, I will talk about using Nearpod to facilitate effective discussions, reading activities, vocabulary activities, and student paced assignments. Additionally, I will show how Nearpod can help inform our future instruction through its post-class reports feature. Although Nearpod cannot solve all our online teaching challenges, it can act as a platform to facilitate interactive classrooms for some activities that benefit both teachers and students.****Ben Rentler is an English lecturer at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan. He has been working in English education for over six years teaching in junior high schools and universities in America and Japan. His research interests include willingness to communicate, CBLT, understanding technology acceptance, translanguaging, and independent learning.********************Malcolm Swanson: Class Management Apps****Particularly for those of us teaching multiple courses in different locations, class management can be a nightmare. Grades, attendance records, and lesson details all need to be collated and maintained. The release of tablets like the iPad has offered numerous ways for handling these tasks more efficiently. In this session, I will introduce two apps that I use extensively, and demonstrate their use.****Malcolm Swanson teaches at Seinan Jo Gakuin University in Kitakyushu. His interests include integrating technology into classrooms and course building with lesson management systems.************
:::Pragmatics in the English Classroom|02/11/2020 11:20:26|/chapters/kq/schedule/2020/october/10|10/10/2020 - 19:00 to 20:30|2020||Jim Ronald|****Pragmatics is usually defined as the study of how people use language in particular situations, contexts, and relationships. As classroom-based English teachers, if we are not simply teaching the textbook or teaching towards tests or exams, we may teach with some future possible situations in mind, and imagine various contexts for using English. These may include hosting students visiting from overseas, or studying abroad and having a homestay experience. We will start by considering how we can help meet some of these possible distant language needs. This will be followed by a focus on actual language needs for situations, contexts, and relationships in class – needs that may often be by-passed using Japanese or gestures. Thinking of these potential or real needs, we’ll try out a few activities for helping learners communicate better in and beyond the classroom. Finally, we will consider a principled approach to developing and using pragmatic activities in class.****Jim Ronald has been teaching English in Hiroshima for over 30 years, at Hiroshima YMCA then at Hiroshima Shudo University. His PhD was concerned with vocabulary acquisition and dictionary use, but his current teaching interests are mainly pragmatics and learner development. He is an active participant in the Pragmatics and Learner Development special interest groups within JALT. ****This will be an online event held over Zoom.

Reasons for teaching GBL to these students stemmed from a desire to provide them with something more than just a place to practice their English and to better prepare them for their future jobs as teachers.****The presentation will go through our thought process towards curriculum design, individual lessons plans, and English and game mechanics chosen to teach. We will present survey results on students opinions on the curriculum and course. Finally, we will showcase the games the students designed as part of course. ****Stephen Case's interests include Task Based Learning and incorporating game design principles into good task design. He has published in books on creative writing and on lessons using short films in the classroom, as well as designing his own board and card games for language learning.

We will try and reschedule****Personal finance is the cornerstone of a comfortable life. If you have good money habits and knowledge you will be able to enjoy your life and spend your time doing interesting and productive things. If you have bad money habits and knowledge you will probably not enjoy your life and will spend a lot of time worrying about money. This session will go through a rapid-fire series of practical personal finance principles and tips for residents of Japan, followed by a question and answer discussion session. This is a new workshop format so should be useful even if you have attended a RetireJapan seminar before.****Come with questions, leave with new ideas and answers.****Ben Tanaka (Shearon) is a university lecturer from Sendai.

:::A Call To Apps: Current Best Practices in Digital Pedagogy|11/18/2019 11:27:24|/chapters/kq/schedule/2020/january/19|01/19/2020 - 13:00 to 14:30|2020||Rab Paterson|****This session will cover a range of current best practices in digital pedagogy, with practical examples drawn from a number of pedagogical approaches to learning and related apps. These will all be demonstrated with examples from the presenter's own classes, showing how a range of apps can be combined in an app-smashing way to maximise educational benefits. However, this session will not just be a typical 'how to use apps' type workshop. The benefits to students in terms of their improved mind-brain learning as a rationale behind the adoption of these apps will also be covered, as will the motivational benefits for students that challenge / project-based learning brings. Everything will be demonstrated in an easily-understood way, making for a session applicable for educators no matter what the range of their edtech skills. After the initial overview and demonstration, the session will become more hands-on, with the presenter working directly with attendees to demonstrate how to set up and use the apps under discussion. The workshop will end with a more traditional Q and A session, although attendees are free to ask pertinent questions throughout the session.****Rab Paterson is Principal Instructor for the Toyo University-UCLA Extension Center for Global Education, Director of the Asia Association for Global Studies, Fellow of the British Royal Asiatic Society, Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, and a JALT TAC member and BizCom Officer.

:::An input task output task framework for TBLT in Japan|04/30/2019 15:46:12|/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/january/16|01/16/2021 - 17:00 to 18:30|2021||Justin Harris|Task-based language teaching (TBLT) is sometimes criticized as being inappropriate for teaching foreign languages in Japan because it focusses too much on oral language skills, and because of its emphasis on students' existing language knowledge and skills. However, such criticisms are arguably the result of misunderstandings of TBLT. This talk will outline and address these criticisms, and will introduce an input/output approach to TBLT that is particularly useful for language classrooms in Japan. The talk will include both a theoretical background to this approach, but will pay particular attention to practical ways it can be implemented in the foreign language classroom.****Justin Harris is an associate professor at Kindai University in Osaka Japan.

Positive outcomes as well as possible pitfalls will be addressed. Both presenters have had extensive experience working with online learning resources and systems.********Using Google Classroom - Paul Collett************Google Classroom is an open platform cloud-based system developed by Alphabet Inc. for setting up assignments and other question types, as well as sharing information with students. It offers the class instructor a convenient platform to create a variety of assignments, questions, or other learning materials. These can easily be accessed and answered inside or outside of class, while a straightforward mechanism for providing feedback on student work allows both the instructor and learners to keep track of learning progress. After a brief introduction to the system, I will look at how it has been integrated into my university-level language classes, and consider other possibilities for use. Feedback from students and other instructors who have been using the system will also be presented.********Using Moodle - Malcolm Swanson************Moodle is another course management system, though this one is open source software that needs to be installed on a domain. It has many of Google Classroom’s features, and a lot more besides. In this part of the presentation, I will detail these similarities, differences, and a few of the advantages, plus show how I have used it as the backbone of our e-learning courses at Seinan Jo Gakuin University. I will also show how it can be used to create self-access style courses with steps that can only be accessed once prior content has been mastered. Finally we will look at the reporting and assessment tools built into the system, plus look briefly at how we have integrated MoodleReader into our Extensive Reading courses.********Paul Collett teaches at Shimonoseki City University, and helps run the ER programme at Seinan Jo Gakuin University.

It also looks at whether or not students in general have favourable or unfavorable views towards taking tests with a partner. It provides insight into whether or not it is a feeling universal to all students, or whether or not there is a difference in perception towards CT depending on the students own confidence or anxiety towards testing, pair work and communication. It gives recommendations on how to test students with different personality types communicative ability, without increasing anxiety and creating an impression of unfairness.************Hudson Murrell's main interests are in Extensive Reading, Comparative Culture, and Study Abroad programs.

This will help us get everyone checked in on the day: http://kqjalt-dornyei.peatix.com****Most people will have come across a curious phenomenon whereby somebody suddenly embarks on a project, invests a great deal of time and energy in it for a period of time and, as a result, often achieves something quite remarkable. This paper  discusses this phenomenon and introduces a novel psychological construct to describe it, ‘Directed Motivational Current’ (DMC). It refers to an intense motivational drive capable of both stimulating and supporting long-term behaviour, such as learning a foreign/second language. DMCs involve unique periods of heightened motivational involvement whereby individuals pursue a goal/vision which is considered personally significant, highly relevant to one’s desired identity and emotionally satisfying – the experience of a DMC carries with it the excitement of journeying down a ‘motivational highway’ towards new pastures. Although such surges occur in numerous guises within the social world, they are admittedly not very frequent and their duration is also limited. This being the case, do they have a more general significance for motivation theory? I will argue in this talk that they do, because DMCs represent an optimal form long-term motivation, one which occurs when all the necessary conditions and components of motivated action are present and act as a harmonious whole. It may be no exaggeration to regard almost any form of long-term motivation as a partial realization of a DMC and, accordingly, understanding how and why a DMC happens will allow us to identify the principal building blocks of sustained motivated behaviour.****Zoltán Dörnyei  (PhD in Psycholinguistics, Budapest; PhD in Theology, Durham) is Professor of Psycholinguistics at the School of English, University of Nottingham.

How do we build that attitude? Positive psychology offers direction. Traditional psychology focuses on mental illness. Positive psychology investigates mental health: What do happy, mentally healthy people do? This is more than “the power of positive thinking.” It’s science, based on real research and replicable studies. TIME magazine dubbed it “the Science of Happiness.” Seligman’s (2011) PERMA model of well being— Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaningfulness, Accomplishment – take positive psychology to a new level which integrates well with our goals as language teachers. For example, positive psychology encourages “active constructive” answers to questions which help people re-experience positivity. Exactly the same behavior helps students practice using questions as a discourse strategy to keep a conversation going. Many more practical ideas will be included.

If language shapes our concepts, L2 words are linked to an L1 word-concept, which may show varying degrees of dissimilarity to the L2 word-concept. This is problematic in classroom situations where students must learn the meaning of L2 words through translation, definition, and/or reading or hearing the new words in co-text. Without the wider context of the socio-cultural reality words simultaneously refer to and depict, it might not be merely difficult for L2 learners to achieve native-like language competence, but impossible. We will reconsider what is involved in learning a foreign language and the implication that focusing on English as a lingua franca may not only be desirable for practical purposes, but also to create an achievable aim for classroom learners. ****Reference****Pavlenko, A.

These features include spaced rehearsal, adaptive learning, increasing retrieval difficulty, the use of an appropriate word counting unit, the presentation of both audio and orthographic forms, the use of context, and the use of the learners’ L1. Findings in the research literature on vocabulary learning are easy to understand, yet difficult to apply to a vocabulary program in practice. As a result, vocabulary programs often fail to help students reach their potential.

To do that, all you really need is some sort of feedback loop that provides insight into performance. With such a loop, common practice activities can be turned into assessment activities (Brown, 2013). Such an approach to oral testing can potentially open up new ideas for assessment that help your students improve their speaking ability. In this theory-lite presentation, we’ll cover various strategies for creating such loops by looking at the pros and cons of typical holistic and analytic marking schemes. Guidance for creating effective feedback/marking rubrics will also be provided. Finally, practical issues regarding administration of in-class speaking tests will also be addressed. No previous experience with conducting speaking tests is required; any teacher interested in learning how to implement oral testing in the classroom is encouraged to attend.****Reference****Brown, J.D.

For most of human existence, we have used stories to share information and educate our offspring about the world.  It is no wonder our brains have evolved to process stories so much more effectively (or did stories evolve to fit our brains?) than other formats of information delivery. In fact, stories do more than allow information transfer. They cause parallel activation of the insula in both speaker and listener that enable a kind of brain linking.****Likewise, no other format of verbal transfer results in as high a retention rate.  A study in London found that use of statistics in a presentation led to a retention rate of 5-10% at best, but by adding a story, retention more than tripled.  With use of stories alone, the retention rate soars to more than tenfold.****But why?  We know stories cause the release of dopamine, cortisol, oxytocin and other learning-related neurotransmitters, but there is another reason as well, one related to something the brain is doing subconsciously every second.****The presenter will discuss research showing how effective stories are, explain the neuroscience behind this phenomenon, and suggest techniques for using them in class, including Rex Tanimoto’s DigiTales.  Be ready to tell your own stories.****Popular speaker and writer, Curtis Kelly (EdD), is a Professor of English at Kansai University in Japan.

The presenter has published extensively within the ESL/EFL market in Japan and will offer helpful advice to budding authors who wish to pursue projects geared to Japan's domestic market and has spoken on this topic at Kitakyushu JALT before. The industry is constantly changing, however, and he offers updated insights into ESL/EFL publishing for budding authors wanting to break into the publishing field. ****Most likely, every language teacher in Japan has (at some point during his/her tenure) contemplated writing a textbook to fill a void in the market...in that constant search for the perfect, all encompassing textbook. In today's competitive publishing world, getting the proverbial foot in the door can seem daunting and nearly impossible. What are publishers looking for in the current market? What appeals to editors who ultimately decide which titles go to production and which ones do not? What are the salespeople on the front lines hearing from their market base? What must an author do in order to get his/her book published?****This presentation focuses on these very questions, offering inside insights from all the various points of view that must be considered when writing a proposal to publish a textbook--the publisher, the editor, the salesperson, and the author. The presenter will explain the realities within the publishing industry and addresses some common myths associated with EFL publishing.****Todd Jay Leonard has been actively involved in book publishing for nearly thirty years and has published twenty books.  He has published books with a number of different Japanese publishing companies and this experience has given him a unique perspective in offering advice to potential authors on what the market is looking for currently and what the publishing industry is searching for in new titles.****

In other fields of pursuit however, practice is considered a vital part of skill learning. Whether it involves learning to drive a car or play the piano, practice is deemed a necessary cognitive process that people have to participate in order to perform any skill of high level. Humans tend to develop skills by receiving knowledge and applying it through practice (Anderson, 2000). But to what extent does this apply to second language acquisition?****Given the degree to which practice is viewed within SLA, this presentation will explore some key cognitive theories that help to explain the effects of practice. The presentation will demonstrate that SLA research to date has produced different accounts on the role of practice, and as a result, a united view does not exist. Nevertheless, it is useful for teachers to be aware of some of the research in order to inform their own ideas.****Colin Thompson lectures at Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka.

Nevertheless, the substantial long-term benefits justify the high degree of commitment needed” (Nation, 2001, p. 156). To be effective, an ER course must be sustainable, and implementing such a programme involves a number of challenges. Instructors and administrators need to ensure a range of suitable reading material is available and easily accessible, either in the learning space or the institution’s library. Students should be able to access books often and easily if they are to read at the levels required for successful extensive reading. Then some system to check if reading is actually being done may be required, especially if it is part of a required or for-credit course. All this needs to be manageable for administrators and teachers who are often hard-pressed for time, and in a way that won’t be overwhelming for students.****In this presentation, we will draw on our experiences of  coordinating, managing, and teaching a university-level extensive reading course to illustrate how such a programme can be set up. We will consider the challenges involved, and how these can be overcome to keep the programme running smoothly. We will also report on student reactions to, and outcomes of, the ER course with particular focus on our use of Moodle Reader and the online xReading system as the backbone of our ER courses.****Paul Collett currently teaches at Shimonoseki City University, and helps run the ER programme at Seinan Jo Gakuin University.

By making every moment of class time count, teachers can help students succeed – on exams and in future jobs. Teachers can build both the traditional four skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and the 21st century 4Cs (communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking) in every class. The secret is building a strong English foundation, so that teachers can spend most of your class time using language to develop the more advanced (and more fun!) integrated skills in student-generated projects.

Many students were using too much Japanese, or hiding silently behind their more enthusiastic classmates.****In the second semester, I instigated a new, experimental assessment design that would reward active participation, rather than accuracy or “correctness”. More importantly, though, I gave the students a comprehensive, organized explanation of my reasoning, hoping it would change their perception of the course.****I heard more English during the next few lessons than I’d heard in the entire first semester! My explanation had really resonated, and the students opened up, apparently no longer burdened by a concern with accuracy.****In this presentation, I’ll go through what I presented to the students, discuss why I think it was so effective, and show how I applied what I learned to subsequent classes.****Steve Paton currently works full time at Fukuoka University.********Yumiko Cochrane: Katakana & English****Katakana words constitute an integral component of the lexicon of  Japanese. While Katakana is primarily used to transcribe foreign words  into Japanese and introduce objects or concepts of foreign origin, its usage  in modern Japanese is so pervasive that its effects, particularly on English  acquisition, are immense.  With a primary emphasis on the importance of raising awareness towards  false friends, this presentation discusses issues and implications involving  English-like Katakana words (loanword cognates) and possible long-term  effects they may have on English acquisition. It first introduces key  linguistic features of loanword cognates and how they are used in  Japanese discourse. Results of the presenter’s exploratory study will also  be presented to show how Japanese adults performed in producing  English equivalents to the lexical items on the test. The presentation also  reviews some of the loanword cognates commonly used in modern Japanese discourse.****Yumiko Cochrane works at Tokyo International Business College and Kyushu Sangyo University.****

This brings the language they’ve studied in their coursework into a familiar context. They could, for example, describe their neighborhood, or introduce their hobby. When they bring these videos into the classroom to show to classmates, this serves as a catalyst for highly personalized conversations. In this presentation, I will discuss the types of assignments given, demonstrate a technologically simple way to collect these videos, and explain how these assignments were expanded through in-class tasks.****

Teachers frequently are asked to not only teach their classes, but to develop entire programs on their own. What strategies can be pursued to create a collaborative environment in schools and what can be learned from the mistakes and misadventures of someone trying to manage a school and teachers?****Jason McDonald is a long time resident of Kanda, Fukuoka, Japan and the owner of Able English School.****
:::Adaptable Vocabulary Activities for ESP and Beyond & Engaging Learners with Lateral Thinking Tasks|10/19/2015 13:59:25|/chapters/kq/schedule/2016/february/13|02/13/2016 - 18:30 to 20:30|||Simon Capper|Join us in February for 2 separate 45-minute presentations from Simon Capper.****Adaptable Vocabulary Activities for ESP and Beyond.****Learners of English with limited proficiency – particularly those learning English for SpecificPurposes (ESP) – are often overwhelmed by the heavy load of unfamiliar vocabulary in theirtextbooks. Avoiding this pitfall requires creative and practical solutions that encouragemeaningful recycling and repetition. Derived from materials created for elementary levelnursing English students, this workshop demonstrates a series of enjoyable, productive gamesand activities based on commonly encountered medical vocabulary, but which are alsoadaptable for general (non-ESP) courses.The activities covered in this workshop will include prefix / suffix dominoes, word rootbattleships, vocabulary bingo, and affix anagrams. Suggestions will also be offered to helpteachers to enable learners to create personalized vocabulary lists using free, readily availableonline vocabulary learning software. ****Engaging Learners with Lateral Thinking Tasks.****Why did a group of men steal teeth from a battlefield at night? Why did the hopeless bank robber fail? Why was the young lady embarrassed by a visit from her grandmother? Lateral thinking puzzles provide excellent task-based, problem-solving, goal-oriented, communicative activities. They encourage maximum involvement, (even in large classes) and offer extensive, meaningful repetition.In this workshop I'll introduce the some lateral thinking puzzles, demonstrate how they can be adapted to the classroom, and offer some tips on how to create your own materials. These puzzles, inspired by the work of pioneering creative thinker Edward de Bono, are adaptable, practical and allow for easy classroom management, while at the same time offering a challenging and entertaining task for learners. If time permits, participants will be encouraged to share their own puzzles, discuss add-on activities and engage in trying out some of the presenter's favourite puzzles.****Simon Capper is a teacher at the Japanese Red Cross Hiroshima College of Nursing.

These choices and actions ultimately determine the success of learning attempts and serve to sustain learner motivation in the classroom and beyond.****Key strategic skills involved in self-regulated learning (whether they relate to goal setting, planning, monitoring, or reflection) are also recognized as crucial aspects of the learning process in literature on learner autonomy and sociocultural conceptions of learning, which have been much more prominent in the field of foreign language learning. Given the many crossovers between these schools of thought, the time seems right for researchers and practitioners from varied traditions to come together and discuss findings and ideas.****This symposium aims to bring together researchers and classroom practitioners to share their research and practical experiences related to self-regulated learning (SRL) and learner autonomy. It is hoped that through participation in this symposium attendees will be able to develop a better understanding of the theoretical and practical issues related to SRL, especially within the Asian context, and the intersections between SRL and learner autonomy research. In this spirit, we also envisage the symposium leading to avenues for future collaboration and research.****Keynote speakers are Dr Garold Murray (Okayama University), and Dr Yoshiyuki Nakata (Hyogo University of Teacher Education).

It is a powerful, popular alternative to such commercial statistical packages as SPSS, with a large user base and extensive documentation and support.****After outlining the basis of obtaining and installing the package we will demonstrate some applications using real data sets to show how it can be used for different types of data analysis, such as generating basic descriptive statistics, correlations, scale validation, and multivariate analysis like cluster analysis, principal components analysis or factor analysis.****We will finish up with a brief look at some of the substantive issues and critiques related to quantitative statistical analysis.****Biodata: The presenter teaches and is involved in ongoing research at Shimonoseki City University.****Session 2:****Objective measurement: An introduction to Rasch analysis****Trevor Holster****Fukuoka Women's University****Although raw percentage scores are commonly used for classroom assessment, research instruments and standardized tests require more sophisticated analysis. Georg Rasch developed a model of objective measurement based on the simple conceptual insight that responses to test questions follow probabilistic patterns rather than machine-like deterministic patterns of success and failure. Higher ability persons have a higher expectation of success on tasks, but the assumption of Rasch models is that sometimes low ability persons succeed and high ability persons fail. Linacre extended Rasch's original model to allow analysis of other facets of performance, such as rater severity in judged performance tests, and this is now one of the most widely used techniques in analyzing language performance tests. This presentation will briefly review Rasch's simple concept of specific objectivity and then demonstrate Rasch analysis using data from a multiple-choice vocabulary test and from judged ratings of classroom presentations. Audience members who wish to try the analysis themselves will be provided with the datasets and the free student versions of the Ministeps and Minifacs software packages (for Microsoft Windows operating systems only).****Biodata: Trevor Holster has a Master’s degree in TESOL, specializing in curriculum design and materials writing.

The initial discussion point will centre on a definition and understanding of what language codes both embody and represent, and also what it actually means to know a language. The next stage will explore the related concepts of personal idiolects and the expression of language identity, and examine how such elements can either consciously or unconsciously affect theoretical understandings and influence teaching practices [such as in the case of markedness]. The third session will lead into a final open forum opportunity by exploring more specific in-class diglossic issues, and challenge participant notions of correctness, acceptability, and accommodation. For each of these sessions, participants will be asked to work collaboratively to both consider and explore the related issues (in small groups), and to also present a summarised version of their groups' collaboration to the forum. ****Michael Phillips graduated with an honours degree in environmental sciences.

:::Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age. Fad or Future?|12/12/2011 10:49:49|/chapters/kq/schedule/2012/september/08|09/08/2012 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Michael Phillips |In the digital age, rapid developments in information and communication technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way that information is processed, how knowledge is produced, and how learning occurs. Given the current overflow of available information, Siemens (2005) proposes a alternative theory of learning, one separate from the limitations of behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. He regards this concept as one driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly changing knowledge foundations. ****This presentation will begin with a theoretical review of connectivist learning theory. In doing so, it will explore some of many questions still being debated, such as:********In the digital age, what is meant by 'learning' and 'knowledge'? ****Do existing learning theories still meet the needs of today’s learners? ****Do they also anticipate the ongoing lifelong needs of the learners of the future? ********Participants will be challenged to consider (in small discussion groups) some of these questions, and related issues in applying connectivist theory. An open forum opportunity will be given at the end of the meeting to allow teachers to discuss issues relevant to their current teaching situations.****Michael Phillips graduated with an honours degree in environmental sciences.

The presenter will begin by reviewing the theoretical background of task-based learning, its advantages and disadvantages before focusing on the role of task complexity, and how tasks can be designed and sequenced to promote learners’ L2 speech, referencing Robinson’s (2003) Cognition Hypothesis as a framework. The talk is supported with quantitative and qualitative data which investigates the impact of task complexity for developing Japanese learners’ L2 speaking skills at the University level.****Colin Thompson is a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire, UK.

:::Equipping Teachers to Incorporate Drama|12/04/2011 18:09:51|/chapters/kq/schedule/2012/march/10|03/10/2012 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Covenant Players Drama Company|We will be presenting a Teacher Workshop, equipping teachers to utilize and incorporate drama in the classroom.  We base our workshop on our ELCP – English  Language Communication Program that we are using in schools for ESL students. ****ELCP is based on the concept that creative involvement circumvents inhibitions about speaking a foreign language and allows the free flow of previously studied vocabulary, grammatical structure and correct accent.  The greatest barrier to a student's progress in a second language is self-consciousness: inhibitions cause hesitation, shyness and learning blocks in using the language as a spoken communication.  A student may be very successful in the written portion of language study and yet be prevented from effective use of the language in listening and speaking because of those inhibitions.  Covenant Players' repertoire of plays and exercises are designed to involve the student, so that the use of the language is most important and the awareness of self is minimized.****It should be remembered that the ELCP is a resource for teachers of English, not a substitute for full-time English instruction.****

:::Developing resources for self-directed learning|11/28/2011 14:05:01|/chapters/kq/schedule/2012/february/11|02/11/2012 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Paul Collett, Kristen Sullivan, Malcolm Swanson|Helping our students to develop as self-regulated learners able to successfully engage with learning tasks involves helping them to acquire certain skills, strategies and approaches that they can apply both in and out of the classroom. This is important both for contributing to positive academic outcomes, and for building and sustaining motivation. One way to achieve this is to introduce resources that make explicit to students what they are expected to learn in a course, and the processes they can use to facilitate and assess their progress.****Based on their experiences, the presenters will lead participants through the steps involved in developing one such resource. The model to be considered, a study progress guide, incorporates can-do statements to help students and teachers clearly understand curriculum goals and requirements, along with goal-setting and self-reflective processes aimed at building awareness, and encouraging implementation, of (meta-) cognitive knowledge and strategies seen as necessary for self-regulated learning.****After a brief conceptual overview and introduction to the study progress guide, we will work with a text to identify key components that can be transformed into can-do statements, an activity replicable with any classroom material. Consideration will also be given to how other materials and activities can be incorporated into the guide to deal with differing learning situations and learner needs.****Paul Collett has been teaching at the university level in Japan for a number of years. His current research interests relate to the psychology of the language learner and social factors influencing self-regulation.****Kristen Sullivan is a lecturer at Shimonoseki City University and co-writer of Impact Conversation 1 & 2.

In addition, learners get to be creative and take chances in an emotional environment; in other words, they have the opportunity to make the target language their own.  Participants in this workshop will explore half a dozen commercial board games for their potential use in their own classrooms.****
:::Here we are, now motivate us: Strategies for generating student motivation|11/07/2011 23:10:26|/chapters/kq/schedule/2011/november/26|11/26/2011 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Andy Boon|You walk into the classroom. The students are at the back chatting with friends, sitting in silence, checking their phones, or resting their heads on the desks. Then, suddenly, the bell sounds. It is the start of the class. How do we as teachers change the classroom dynamic to one where learning can take place for all concerned? How do we create an environment and experience that will spark our students' natural curiosity and eagerness to develop? Once in action, how can we help nurture and sustain their interest throughout the lesson when learner motivation is constantly at threat. This presentation will provide an overview of Dornyei's motivational teaching practice model (2001), describe its practical application in the L2 classroom, and explore strategies for generating, maintaining and protecting student motivation. The audience will be invited to share their own experiences of and suggestions for stimulating teen spirit.****Andrew Boon is an associate professor in the faculty of humanities at Toyo Gakuen University.

:::Teaching and learning English humour, in principle and practice|09/27/2010 12:18:43|/chapters/kq/schedule/2010/november/13|11/13/2010 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Richard Hodson|One question in the review section of a popular textbook widely used in conversation classes asks, ‘Can you tell a joke in English?’ but in the presenter’s experience students rarely, if ever, attempt this question. Why not? How can learners be encouraged to experiment with humour, and what materials can teachers provide to help them do so? Successfully telling, and even understanding, a joke in a foreign language is a challenging activity that demands linguistic skill, but also one that provides learners with valuable opportunities for language practice, access to cultural knowledge, and also to the cognitive and affective benefits of creative language play.****In the first part of the session, the presenter will outline the key pedagogical and cultural issues that need to be considered when introducing humorous materials in the EFL classroom, including insights both from humour theory, and from recent ELT research, which has begun to suggest broad guidelines for the selection and use of humorous input texts. The second half of the presentation will describe, and report results from, two recent research projects. In the first, students rated a series of thematically-linked newspaper cartoons, and wrote their own original captions, which were in turn rated both by their peers, and by a group of native speakers of English. In the second project, students were introduced to a series of jokes linked to everyday forms and functions found in typical communication classes and texts, which they rated and then used as the basis for their own experiments with English humour, by adapting, recreating, and expanding on the jokes provided.****Richard Hodson is a lecturer in the Faculty of Global Communication at the University of Nagasaki, Siebold (長崎県立大学シーボルト校 国際交流学科)****

The plenary speaker for this event will be Scott Thornbury who will be talking about How To Make Grammar Easy (By First Making It Difficult!). There will also be three local speakers giving presentations of special interest to JTEs in elementary and secondary schools.****Matthew Jenkins—Fun And Easy-Japanesey!!****Summary: Teaching only in the target language can be daunting for language teachers. In this class, Matthew will teach an activity for an introductory English class, using only English. He will then teach an activity for an introductory Japanese class using only Japanese. He will create a fun, easy and relaxed class with his students using gestures, teachers’ aides, and humor. If you want to make monolingual classrooms fun and easy, don’t miss this presentation!****Bio: Matthew Jenkins has an MA in applied linguistics, a business degree, and is currently completing a Masters of Teaching. He has taught at university, and currently teaches junior high school and elementary school children. His hobbies include surfing, camping, martial arts, and travel. ****Yukiko Arima—Easy Steps To More English Use In The Classroom****Summary: According to the survey by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, only less than 30 percent of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs) at junior high school reach the expected English level and less than 30% of the teachers use English at least half of the time in the classroom. These results tell us that many JTEs may not feel confident with their own English skills –at least not enough to use more English in the classroom. When JTEs don’t use much English in the classroom, they give not only themselves but also their students less chances to acquire English skills as real communication tools. This creates a vicious circle for language learning. They need to break this vicious circle and to let themselves become active language learners first. However, as the survey showed, there seems to be a big gap between what should be done by JTEs and the reality in the classrooms. Some hints will be suggested to JTEs as their first step to use more English in the classroom confidently.****Bio: After one year of English teaching experience as a new teacher,****I decided to go to Australia to see, hear, and feel a real overseas life. Through the stay in Australia for 7 years, I learned a lot of “生きた英語(ikita eigo)”, which is English that is used in a real communication, not on a textbook.****Having come back to Japan with the academic knowledge and experience of language teaching, and also with “Aussie culture” of course, I’ve been enjoying sharing them with my Japanese students in the classroom.****Hiroshi Otani—Teaching English In English—Easier Advocated Than Done In Japan****Summary: In his college days, the speaker taught English in English at an English Conversation School in Tokyo, and as a student teacher at Kokura High School, Hiroshi Otani spoke almost nothing but English in front of the students from the morning homeroom period through the clean-up periond after class. But on becoming a professional teacher of English a year later, he found it hard to use a lot of English in his class. And basically he experiences the same kind of difficulty doing so at his current school as well. Why is that? His command of English should be good enough for all- English class management, but there are several factors that discourage both the teacher and his students from using English between them in Japan. Nonetheless, Japanese high school teachers of English will have to teach English primarily in English according to the new guideline that is to start in April, 2013. He will share some ideas about how JTEs can start teaching English in English for their students and briefly discuss several factors that hinder many Japanese people from using English.****Scott Thornbury—How To Make Grammar Easy (By First Making It Difficult!)****Summary: Traditionally, grammar is presented, practised and produced (PPP). Durable learning, however, probably depends as much on the learners discovering things for themselves, and the raising of awareness that results. How can teachers engineer this?  One way is by “problematizing” grammar, that is, by posing grammar problems, the solving of which may trigger a restructuring of the learner's internal grammar. Combined with personalization, you have a PP approach, as opposed to the old PPP one.****Bio: I’m originally from New Zealand, and I started my ELT career in IH London in 1975, where my initial training cost me just £65. Now I work for an MA TESOL program run by the New School, New York. I teach online, with two months’ face-to-face teaching in New York in the summer. The experience of teaching online has been enormously interesting.A glance at my bibliography would suggest that my main interest is grammar – I have written (or co-written) five books with the word grammar in the title. In fact, this is misleading. I’m really more interested in teaching – in methodology, in fact – and grammar teaching just happens to be part of that. ****Location: Kitakyushu International Conference Center.

This presentation reports on a project that attempts to respond to this objective. More specifically it describes efforts to introduce task-based learning into a university-level EFL program. It will demonstrate, by way of a series of examples, how communicative tasks were administered to a class of 24 adult learners of English to develop their oral communication strategies and to draw the learners’ attention to the usage of potentially problematic features of the language such as articles. The presenters will begin by outlining the rationale for selecting a task-based approach to developing communication skills and will then go on to describe a methodology that employs ordering and sorting tasks to promote interaction, negotiation of meaning and opportunities for students to reflect on the accuracy of the language used. The presenters will conclude by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using tasks in their particular learning context and will discuss how their efforts led to the wider use of tasks in their curriculum.************Neil Millington is a lecturer at APU Ritsumeikan University where he teaches Fundamental and Intermediate English classes.

:::Language Awareness and Language Variety: Ways to Utilize Tacit Knowledge in Language Classrooms|09/17/2009 14:10:43|/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/october/10|10/10/2009 - 18:00 to 20:00|2019||Saeko Urushibara|********I will propose that English education in Japan, at the elementary school level in particular, be conducted in a larger setting of “Language Awareness”.  This notion includes the following: First, language is a unique symbolic system that allows novel utterances, recursion and so on.  Second, such properties are shared by languages of the world despite apparent differences.  Thus education based on language awareness necessarily involves reflections on the first language and calls for realizing not only language variety but also universal properties that lie behind it.************The view that language has universal properties is supported by researchers in many fields of linguistics: pioneering linguists e.g. de Saussure, Sapir, language typologists e.g., Greenberg, Comrie, theoretical linguists, e.g., Chomsky, and so on.  One can safely say that language is a genetically-endowed property specific to humans.  Given that, it must be that such universality, or our tacit knowledge of language, is activated in the first language acquisition, the second language acquisition and foreign language acquisition/learning.  Therefore, I argue that emphasizing aspects of language that are shared by the first and the target languages will facilitate learners’ access to the target language.  It will also enhance motivation for language learning.************After clarifying that English in Japan is a foreign, not the second, language, I will discuss how we should divide aspects of language and match the sections with appropriate teaching methods.  Vocabulary, or Saussurean signs, is arbitrary in principle, and therefore has to be explicitly “learned”, although learners will soon discover many subregularities as they go by.  Much of grammatical knowledge, on the other hand, is universal, as mentioned above, so comes cost-free in principle.  Hence all we have to do is explicate our tacit knowledge of language, such as “headedness” and “ambiguity”.  I will show examples of how to do that in learners’ first language (in our case Japanese) and then how to apply such knowledge to the target language (English).  For the aspects of grammar that are different between the first and the target languages, such as word order and agreement, I will introduce ways to fill them in, by utilizing “parameters”.************In the remaining part of the talk I hope to touch on the “division of labor” between human resources (language teachers and learners) and machines (CALL).  Specifically, I compare CALL to gym exercise and argue that it is best utilized in vocabulary (words and idioms) learning and distinction of phonological patterns that are lacking in learners’ first language.************Saeko Urushibara is the Director of the Center for Fundamental Education at the University of Kitakyushu.

The terms blogging, wiki-ing, podcasting, and vodcasting may still be unknown to some students (and teachers), but they are being seriously considered by language teachers around the world for application in the classroom and use in self-access learning. Podcasting is one concept that many oral communication teachers are experimenting with. Podcasts, and other forms of online listening, provide a wide range of authentic and pedagogically-driven listening materials for use both in and out of the classroom. And with the necessary tools, students can even make their own podcasts. This presentation will consider the latter notion of podcasting – student-authored podcasting – and will discuss the pedagogical and social benefits, and potential pitfalls, of incorporating podcasting into classroom activities. Through a discussion of her own experiences of using podcasting in the classroom, the presenter will consider the pros and cons of classroom podcasting, the necessary stages before beginning a podcast project, and several ideas for designing podcasting activities. Participants will also be encouraged to think about possible uses of student-authored podcasting in their own classroom settings.************Kristen Sullivan is a Lecturer at Shimonoseki City University.

:::Putting Our Heads Together: A Discussion of Textbook Abandonment and Extensive Reading|06/21/2008 16:26:59|/chapters/kq/schedule/2008/july/12|07/12/2008 - 19:00 to 21:00|||Various|This month, we're going to give some time to talk about topics that merit discussion, but haven't had their own program recently. There will be something for everyone! If there's a topic you'd like to discuss, let us know or bring it along.********Extensive Reading—ER is becoming more and more popular, and lots of people have been experimenting with it. Have you set up or run a program at your institution, or incorporated into your courses? Come tell us how your program is structured and how it's working, and if you're thinking about starting one, come learn how others have done it.****Throwing away the textbook—We've all run into the limitations of textbooks....and sometimes courses can work well without them. Have you done classes without a text? How did it go? What have your experiences been with replacing texts with your own materials and ideas? Please share your experiences and suggestions.****Ongoing or planned research projects—What kinds of research are you doing, or what are you interested in? Is there any area for collaboration between members? What are we finding, or hoping to learn, from our research? How can our local chapter assist our members with their research - or how can JALT as a national body assist us?********

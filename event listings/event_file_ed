What you learn in the first session will connect and compound with every other session at the FAB conference! We believe in active learning -so be prepared to focus on the content and speak up during the Power Sessions. By the end of the conference, you will have a notebook full of take home activities and a brain full of new ideas and inspiration for your classrooms!

All FAB1 proceeds after costs will also be donated to charity.****

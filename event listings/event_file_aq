:::Promoting Sustainable Education: A Cross-Cultural Hybrid Framework for Japanese and Nepalese Younger Learners|05/21/2021 21:29:38|/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/september/11|09/11/2021 - 17:30 to 19:00|2021||Namiko Tsuruta|****There is a strong disconnect between how English is still taught in schools, and its prevalence as an international language in our interconnected digital world. Moreover, many young adults lack confidence and a voice, often detached from issues in Japanese society. Are our traditional approaches to English language instruction preparing our learners to become active and global participants of the “Experience Age”?****The presenter hopes to inspire foreign language teachers through a one-year, hybrid, cross-cultural (Nepal-Japan) SDG program. The framework can be implemented in any secondary school to involve our learners to become autonomous thinkers in an ever-evolving, multilingual world.****Namiko Tsuruta has taught for 23 years in Kanto and trained Japanese teachers and ALTs in schools for many years. She is a graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall and the University of Michigan. She is currently Program Director of Global Language Institute and Creative Director of The Tokyo Life.****This meeting will br taking place over Zoom.

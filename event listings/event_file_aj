If you have good money habits and knowledge you will be able to enjoy your life and spend your time doing interesting and productive things. If you have bad money habits and knowledge you will probably not enjoy your life and will spend a lot of time worrying about money. ****This session will go through a rapid-fire series of practical personal finance principles and tips for residents of Japan, followed by a question and answer discussion session. This is a new workshop format so should be useful even if you have attended a RetireJapan seminar before. Come with questions, leave with new ideas and answers.****Ben Shearon (Tanaka) was a university lecturer in Sendai (he retired from formal work in March 2022). He has been in Japan since July 2000, and has run the RetireJapan website since 2013.

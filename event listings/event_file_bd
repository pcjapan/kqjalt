Following that I will describe a series of action research projects that I have conducted since 2011 in English conversation classes at two small universities, and I will explain how the insights that I have received have helped me become a better English teacher. Finally, I will lead the participants through a series of tasks that will help them design their own action research projects.****Michael Stout is a full-time lecturer at Hakuoh University.

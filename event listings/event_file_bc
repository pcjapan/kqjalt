:::An input task output task framework for TBLT in Japan|04/30/2019 15:46:12|/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/january/16|01/16/2021 - 17:00 to 18:30|2021||Justin Harris|Task-based language teaching (TBLT) is sometimes criticized as being inappropriate for teaching foreign languages in Japan because it focusses too much on oral language skills, and because of its emphasis on students' existing language knowledge and skills. However, such criticisms are arguably the result of misunderstandings of TBLT. This talk will outline and address these criticisms, and will introduce an input/output approach to TBLT that is particularly useful for language classrooms in Japan. The talk will include both a theoretical background to this approach, but will pay particular attention to practical ways it can be implemented in the foreign language classroom.****Justin Harris is an associate professor at Kindai University in Osaka Japan.

He is a founding member of the JALT TBL SIG, and is the conference chair of the TBLT in Asia biennial conference.

:::Self-regulation in Foreign Language Learning: Shared Perspectives|07/29/2013 13:27:53|/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/december/07|12/07/2013 - 10:00 to 12/08/2013 - 15:00|2019||Garold Murray, Yoshiyuki Nakata, others|Self-regulation in learning refers to the cognitive and behavioral processes learners apply when engaging with learning tasks or activities. These choices and actions ultimately determine the success of learning attempts and serve to sustain learner motivation in the classroom and beyond.****Key strategic skills involved in self-regulated learning (whether they relate to goal setting, planning, monitoring, or reflection) are also recognized as crucial aspects of the learning process in literature on learner autonomy and sociocultural conceptions of learning, which have been much more prominent in the field of foreign language learning. Given the many crossovers between these schools of thought, the time seems right for researchers and practitioners from varied traditions to come together and discuss findings and ideas.****This symposium aims to bring together researchers and classroom practitioners to share their research and practical experiences related to self-regulated learning (SRL) and learner autonomy. It is hoped that through participation in this symposium attendees will be able to develop a better understanding of the theoretical and practical issues related to SRL, especially within the Asian context, and the intersections between SRL and learner autonomy research. In this spirit, we also envisage the symposium leading to avenues for future collaboration and research.****Keynote speakers are Dr Garold Murray (Okayama University), and Dr Yoshiyuki Nakata (Hyogo University of Teacher Education). See the symposium website for their abstracts. Details of other speakers and schedule will be available on the symposium website closer to the event.****The symposium will be taking place at Shimonoseki City University, Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi prefecture.****

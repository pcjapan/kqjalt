:::TOEIC vocabulary teaching: applying CLIL|12/16/2012 18:30:44|/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/january/12|01/12/2013 - 18:30 to 20:00|||Takashi Uemura|Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is a pedagogic approach to develop L2 learners’ communicative competence by focusing on both teaching subject and language. However, there has been little research on implementing CLIL in TOEIC courses, as TOEIC mainly tests learners’ business English proficiency. First, the presenter will explore theoretical framework of CLIL and its effectiveness in TOEIC vocabulary teaching. Then, he will demonstrate a TOEIC vocabulary seminar applying CLIL. The teacher plays a role as both language teacher and content teacher by making the most of his former experiences.****Takashi Uemura is an MA student in TEFL/TESL at the University of Birmingham.

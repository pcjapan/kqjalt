## Learner Development SIG Grants

This year the Learner Development SIG is aiming to support current SIG members by offering research grants, PAN-SIG and JALT National conference grants as well as the SIG's 20th anniversary conference. Also, in order to reach out to potential new members in under-represented areas of the SIG, we are offering free LD SIG memberships / subscriptions. In particular, we are hoping to encourage elementary school teachers / teachers of children, junior and senior high school teachers, language school teachers, and teachers currently doing graduate studies to join the SIG so that we can broaden our range of perspectives on issues connected with learner development and learner & teacher autonomy. This, we trust, will enrich opportunities for collaborative learning among SIG members.

The deadline for all this year’s Learner Development SIG Grants  is March 5th, except for the JALT National conference grants and the LD-SIG 20th Anniversary grants (for which the deadline is June 20th). Please note that applications can be made in Japanese or English.

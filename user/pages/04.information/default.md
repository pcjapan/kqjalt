<h1>Introduction to Kitakyushu JALT</h1>
<h2>What is JALT?</h2>
<p>
JALT stands for <a href="http://jalt.org" title="National web site for JALT">The Japan Association for Language Teaching</a>, a professional organisation dedicated to the improvement of language learning and teaching in Japan. It functions as a vehicle for the exchange of ideas and techniques, and a means of keeping abreast of new developments in this rapidly changing field. 
</p>
<p>
Currently JALT has over 30 chapters with nearly 3,000 members located throughout Japan. In addition to local activities, an <a href="https://jalt.org/main/conference" title="Link to our annual conference web site">annual conference</a> is held every year. Members also receive a bi-monthly publication, <a href="https://www.jalt-publications.org/tlt/" title="Web site for The Language Teacher">The Language Teacher</a> (also available online) featuring articles and information relating to language learning and teaching. <a href="https://www.jalt.org/jj/" title="Web site for the JALT Journal">The JALT Journal</a> is also published annually containing both practical and theoretical articles and research reports.

<h2>Kitakyushu JALT - Our Local Chapter</h2>
<p>
The local Kitakyushu Chapter, while not so big, has already proven itself to be one of the most active in the country. We hold monthly meetings, usually on the second Saturday of every month.
</p>
<p>
Our events are held in or near Kokura, but check our <a href="location" title="getting to JALT">venue map for details</a>. Attendance for JALT members is free, and non-members pay a mere &yen;1,000 for a one-day membership. 
</p>
<p>
Most meetings feature a guest speaker, who will present on a topic relevant to language teaching. Past meetings have covered a wide range of topics, from language games to brain science and SLA. Intense discussion invariably follows!

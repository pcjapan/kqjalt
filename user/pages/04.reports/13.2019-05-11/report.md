Designing EFL Materials that Work
Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto
Ms. Hoskins gave a workshop and presentation on Saturday, May 11, discussing her very successful children’s textbook Let’s Go and why it has remained the EFL standard for children’s texts for the past couple of decades.  She talked about how there needs to be a balance in the textbooks, and in EFL materials, between the students, the teachers, the content and the parameters of the text.  EFL materials must pay attention to all four elements if they are to be successful.
Ms. Hoskins talked at length about designing materials in such a way that the teacher will know what to do with the material, and also the students will be able to intuit what is expected of them.  The content needs to be geared for the intended learner with an eye to any potential cultural land mines that might spring up - such as having dogs inside the house or foods being discussed.  
The presentation lasted from 7 pm to 9 pm and there were 14 in attendance.

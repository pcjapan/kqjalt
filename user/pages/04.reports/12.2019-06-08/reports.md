Teaching Methods in a Blended English Learning Environment
Huy Tran
On Saturday, June 8, 2019, Huy Tran presented Teaching Methods in a Blended English Learning Environment.  Mr. Tran described his own school in Kikuchi where students use computers to study English.  He called it a Flipped Classroom where students do their homework at the school and then learn the lessons at home.  Through extensive use of things like Skype in the Classroom as well as a number of other apps, students create language and learn independently and in groups.  Mr. Tran provided an excellent video of the presentation that can be found here:

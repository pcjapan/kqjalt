Dictionary Use Panel
Mark Gibson; Eiki Hattori; Go Yoshizawa; David Latz
* Instructors at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of English language education in the Kitakyushu area shared their successes, failures and insights from using dictionaries in their classes.
        Frustrated at the lack of appropriate elementary level bilingual dictionaries, Mark Gibson made his own-- and his students know that every new word they learn is in it, very useful in the development of a unique curriculum in his private school.
* Eiki Hattori and his colleagues have Jr. HS students create their own dictionaries to prepare for vocabulary tests.  New words and phrases are included with phonetic signs, accent markings and Japanese definitions.
* Go Yoshizawa showed three different kinds of electronic dictionaries used in his high 
school and explained some of their merits, such as the Jump feature to explain the meaning of an unknown word used in the definition of another; and the word quiz as an ice-breaker to start a class.  They are also very useful for rephrasing English sentences.
* David Latz gives his university classes fifteen weekly vocabulary quizzes, which mimic the T.O.E.I.C. Bridge Test in requiring more than one usage of a wordâ€”and in turn prepares them well for that test, whose score is included in their grade.

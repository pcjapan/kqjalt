Adapting Websites and Games for the Classroom
Stephen Case
Stephen discussed how games, both digital and traditional card games, can be utilized to develop and facilitate classroom tasks and activities that both engage students and encourage cooperative language development. Stephen suggested that teachers should keep an open mind about how simple sandbox smartphone games can serve as mini-tasks for the language classroom. He also demonstrated the practical pedagogical benefits of party-themed card games. Stephen ended the presentation by having the audience play through a card game and discuss how that kind of game could be incorporated into their own teaching situation.

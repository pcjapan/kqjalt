Mindsets and Foreign Language Learning
Michael Berg
Mr. Berg presented his thesis from his paper on how mindset, either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset, affects language learning, with a specific focus on Japan.  He found that a fixed mindset, one where natural talent is expected to succeed in language acquisition tasks, often has a negative impact as students write off language acquisition as too difficult.  It is possible, he argued to overcome this mindset through intervention.  
Whether natural talent or learned skills is most important is greatly debated, but, what appears, he argued, to be more important is what the student believed.  He then went through the methodology he used to gauge student mindsets.  
Using surveys and then interviews he looked at linguistic and social backgrounds as well as possible gender biases.  He suspected that there might be some limitations to the methods as there were fewer upper year students taking the surveys and students frequently did not take the surveys seriously.  
He found that major does not correlate with mindset nor were there indicators within university entrance requirements nor overseas experience.  Mindset is a very individual thing, he argued.
The presentation lasted from 7 pm to 9 pm and was attended by 12 people.

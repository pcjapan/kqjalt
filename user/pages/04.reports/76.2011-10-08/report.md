Lightning Presentations Night
various speakers
Charles Ashley reviewed the history of error correction and reported on his experience with a workbook to correct common errors, concluding that his students’ level was too low for them to recognize the errors and that teachers must be aware of the Been Here Too Long syndrome, in which they no longer recognize some errors.
Ai Murphy talked about the brain theory behind anger management and how it leads to better learning for our students and children.
Paul Collett outlined three student approaches to learning--mastery, performance, and performance avoidance—and detailed their implications for the classroom.  He emphasized the need to teach students goal-setting through modeling and scaffolding.
Matthew Jenkins introduced three quick activities that can be adapted for students of all ages—the Janken Bon Voyage Mixer, the Vocabunator, and Hot Potatoes quizzes.
Margaret Orleans explained how she tries to create an English atmosphere in her classrooms with bulletin boards, computer games, and displays of student work.
Robert Murphy unveiled his formula for creating champion students—a mix of emotion, curiosity, empowerment through choice, and adequate sleep.

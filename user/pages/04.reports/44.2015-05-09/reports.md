Card games and vocabulary building
Adam Stone
Adam introduced a card game that can be used to both introduce new vocabulary and strengthen the lexical recognition of already learned vocabulary. For the first part of the presentation, the audience was taught the rules of the game and were allowed to play the game using made-up words. Adam then introduced a simple computer program he has developed that can be used to quickly generate game cards from any set of L1/L2 vocabulary pairs. For the final part of the presentation, the audience tested themselves on their acquisition of the target vocabulary and added input regarding the deployment of the game and its practical uses in the language classroom.

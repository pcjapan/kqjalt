Making Money Online
Todd Beuckens
     Beuckens loves teaching English as a foreign language, appears passionate about his hobby, entrepreneurship, and shared lots of information with us from his years of experience.
     He showed us the basics of starting an online businessâ€”from finding something lacking in the vast TEFL field ("How many here have had to work with a textbook they hated?"), to filling that niche, then getting the project operating, getting people to use it-- and monetizing it.
     He credits his initial motivation for online publishing to a student who kept demanding more resources. His thriving online Elllo (English Listening Lesson Library Online) was completely free for three years, until it started attracting sponsors.
     Pointing out that starting a business was mostly about attending to all the details, Beuckens listed several useful outsourcing services, elicited from the audience (and rewarded with cookies) lists of salable digital items under the headings of Ads, Products and Services and then got us into groups to create and record language exercises which he will soon upload to the free site 
     Attracting the biggest turnout at our chapter in years, this presentation gave a good picture of the time, effort and dedication required to make a useful website.

Creative Variations for Textbook Conversations; Assessing Gains in Extensive Reading 
Bill Pellowe; J. Lake
Kitakyushu hosted two presenters this month: Creative Variations for Textbook Conversations, by Bill Pellowe and Assessing Gains in Extensive Reading by J. Lake. In the first presentation, Bill talked about various methods for adapting English conversation textbooks to various classroom settings, offering several unique approaches for engaging students such as having students use smartphones for recording and assessing dialogue performance. In the second half, J. Lake presented recent research findings supporting the incorporation of reading for speed as a means for improving learner reading fluency, motivation, test scores, and streamlining various cognitive and neurological processes that strengthen overall language competency.

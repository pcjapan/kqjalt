FAB 5 (International Conference)
Various presenters
Fab 5 started, as usual, with online required and recommended pre-reading to "get everyone on the same page". Friday afternoon and evening featured an advanced workshop exclusively for presenters and those enrolled in the certificate course. Saturday started with examinations of connections between memory and language processing, moving into the first of four plenary broadcasts by featured speaker Vanessa Rodriguez, shifting focus from the learning to the teaching brain. This was followed by pecha kucha presentations, lectures, workshops and demonstrations by a diverse international group of academics sharing a strong interest in language teaching impacting the intercultural mind from a neurolinguistic viewpoint-- all scheduled around a uniquely organized set of book and poster sessions and continually relieved by energy breaks involving yogic breathing and meditation to maintain the frenetic pace throughout the entire three days.  Lesson planning, textbook adaptation and computer games designed to optimally stimulate learners enjoyably and dynamically were introduced and practiced in novel ways. In the final session the 50 original main maxims of the conference were reviewed and condensed into seven practical tips for lesson planning.
The dinner and banquet/beer garden organized events went over very well and the overall social ambiance was stimulating and friendly.

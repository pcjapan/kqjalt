Dogme in ELT: A demonstration
Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto
In true Dogme fashion, rather than telling us what the approach is about, Sakamoto had us co-construct a definition by sharing in groups what we already knew about it and formulating questions to ask her.  We came to the conclusion that Dogme teaching is conversation-driven, materials-light and focused on emergent language.        We then did a typical group conversation activity (answering three questions about our names) while also taking notes on useful vocabulary and patterns that emerged.  In order to give students an opportunity to practice the language in a subsequent lesson, we designed student-centered tasks.  Finally we discussed possible roadblocks to Dogme (which was adapted for European language teaching from a Danish film movement) in the Japanese environment and how to deal with them.

Because our October meeting will be a PechaKucha Night, we also enjoyed a brief explanation and demonstration of PechaKucha by Jose Cruz.

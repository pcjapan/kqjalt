Online learning from a student’s perspective
Miguel Mision

For our first presentation in 2022, Miguel provided us with some interesting insights from his investigation into how his students feel about learning English online. 

The research took place between 2020 and 2021. The research approach consisted of interviews and surveys that targeted first and second year non-English major Japanese university students. Through this investigation he hoped to better understand his students’ impressions of online lessons in comparison with traditional face-to-face lessons.

The most surprising results were the large number favourable responses he received towards online learning. Students indicated that being online made them feel much more relaxed as it is easier to look things up during class. In addition to that, online lessons allowed them to customize their personal space to create a more comfortable learning environment. For example, students mentioned that they could have a bigger desk at home and could place snacks within easy reach whereas such luxuries are not possible in a classroom.

Another advantage was that they felt less physical exhaustion as online lessons meant that they could save time by avoiding a tiring commute to campus. This time saving allowed students to catch up on more sleep and resulted in students quickly getting used to online lessons after the first year.

Miguel also noted to his dismay that his students actually felt closer to the teacher during Zoom classes than they did to face-to-face ones. He speculated that online lessons gave students more freedom to contact the teacher directly whereas they felt more intimidated speaking up during a traditional lesson. 


Despite their overall positive assessment of online lessons, they did however express some complaints. Group work was one such area. Here, during Zoom breakout sessions where students were put into groups, they reported that it was hard to speak when there was more than one other person in the room. It was also the case that sometimes there would be a person who wouldn’t speak at all. Another issue was that they found breakout room countdown timers to be stressful and distracting.

Students liked the freedom to access on-demand video content, however these videos should not be too long. 100-minute classes for example were tiring, with 10 to 20 min videos being easier for students to maintain focus. 

Other problems from the students’ perspective included:

* Online lesson didn’t really give students many opportunities to make friends.
* Students wanted more consistency with how online lessons are taught. They had to relearn how to do lessons for each of their classes. 
* Students sometimes felt bad about communicating online due to cameras being turned off and occasional connection problems, 

In conclusion, Miguel found student attitudes to online learning were not as bad as what he had expected, however students felt that there were still some disadvantages. To overcome these disadvantages, he recommended hosting a non-educational/social online meeting to encourage team-building. Also, during breakout sessions, he recommended formalizing the roles of all participants. For example, assigning one member to become a scribe, another to be a chairperson etc. And in applying the findings to face-to-face classes, teachers could possibly make an effort to better furnish classrooms to create a more relaxing atmosphere.

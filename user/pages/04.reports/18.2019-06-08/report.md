A Workshop: Sequencing Classroom Activities / Tasks for More Effective Communication
Charlie Bell
On Saturday, February  9th, 2019, Charlie Bell gave a presentation about sequencing classroom activities for more effective communication. The presentation started with a discussion about some of the common issues teachers face when implementing communicative teaching methods. The presenter then proceeded to explain, using examples of his own classroom hand-outs, how the correct sequencing of classroom tasks can lead to greater learner participation and increased understanding in communicative tasks. The second half of the presentation was run as a workshop. Guided by the presenter, participants were given the opportunity to work together to design a sequence tasks for use in their own classroom.

Issues relating to independently run English language schools
Mark Gibson, Gareth Steele, Lawrence Chivers
Alternating between individual rotating presentations and discussion in small groups or collectively, these three school owners shared a lot of very useful information on starting up a new school or improving or expanding on an existing business, and ways of attracting and keeping students in any size or scale of private language teaching. After outlining their range of discussion from starting up through keeping going, marketing and management, they focused in on the particulars of this line of business, starting with location, licensing, pricing, size and curriculum. Marketing advice included flyers, web-pages, word of mouth, billboard advertising and print media, very welcome for anyone interested in getting more students, whether on a large or small scale, in addition to such insights as regarding potential competition as potential cooperationâ€”where teachers can pass on students to a more appropriate class level elsewhere and expect the same in return.  Useful direction regarding what one needs to succeed included tips on getting everything done whether you like it or not as well as maintaining good communication with staff, students and parents, remembering that no complaints does not necessarily mean no problems, and generally getting most of the fundamental right most of the time.

Gender differences and literacy
Michael Berg
Michael began his discussion by reviewing several ways men and women have been suggested to differ physically, psychologically, and cognitively in addition to touching on the extent to which these differences are a result of biological hardwiring, social programming, or a combination of these two factors. He then turned discussion to the various gender issues that can arise in modern day language classrooms and how teachers may better adapt their pedagogical practices to meet the various strengths and weaknesses of both sexes.

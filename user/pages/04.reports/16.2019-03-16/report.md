The Blended Classroom - Taking Learning Online
Paul Collett, Malcolm Swanson
Mr. Collett and Mr. Swanson gave a presentation and workshop on March 16, discussing using online tools in the classroom, specifically Moodle and Google Classroom.  Mr. Collett walked the audience through the various pros and cons of the Google Classroom and Mr. Swanson discussed Moodle.  Both halves of the presentation were very practical, with attention being paid to how to set up an online classroom using either platform.  Both platforms have different benefits and costs and these were highlighted quite clearly during the presentation.
There were 9 in attendance and the presentation lasted from 7 pm to 9 pm.

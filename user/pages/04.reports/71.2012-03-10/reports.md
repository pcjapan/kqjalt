Equipping Teachers to Incorporate Drama
Covenant Players
Our chapter was treated to another session with the Covenant Players; this time it was Kate, Cathy and Kurt who gave us some new tools to take back to the classroom.  Introducing themselves as actors rather than teachers, they explained their purpose as being to encourage speaking to break down barriers of hesitation from inhibitions—a major requirement for successful language practice.
With their repertoire of over 3,000 plays, bare stage style, they often work on a thematic basis—including teaching culture with teaching language.  They start with getting ideas from the students as to setting and mood, get them involved right from the beginning.  Invite them to imagine they're in a large auditorium instead of a classroom and add the accoutrements such as lights, curtains, stage, seats, aisle, mike, etc., pulling out the vocabulary and reinforcing it and grammar with repetitions.
Spelling each other off seamlessly in speaking, demonstrating and whiteboard writing, they walked us through games and skits for stress and intonation awareness.  Reminiscent of Theater Sports and other improv organizations, they got everyone involved in real educational entertainment.  These workshops are based on their ELCP – English Language Communication Program that they use in schools for ESL students.

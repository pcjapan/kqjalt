Love That Dog: Making a Difference with Multimedia
Linda K. Kadota
Kadota first asked how many of us taught poetry and used iPods or other technology.  She said many teachers are afraid of poetry.  Her classes begin with riddles, which is a good and fun way to get students thinking outside of the box.  (What’s a deer with no eyes?  No idea.)  This starts them thinking about words and meanings in new ways; some get the answers, some come up with new answers.  Motivation is vital; if teachers cannot maintain it, classes will fail.
 
Incorporating into the classroom the five basic types of multimedia—text, video, sound, graphics and animation--we can use technology to help students better access the English language and appreciate the existence of multiple levels of meaning within it.  At first students cannot imagine they can write poetry—but realize by the end that they are poets.  Among many examples of zany and innovative poetry on her handout is the url of a web-based concrete poetry generator and new verses generated from Love That Dog by Sharon Creech, a text designed for teaching fourth grade students in the U.S.  The handout also included compelling lists of the benefits of classroom multimedia use for both students and teachers.

Becoming a Better English Teacher Through Action Research
Michael Stout
Michael Stout led the audience through a well-paced and thoughtfully-structured overview of how Action Research (AR) can benefit teachers.
After beginning with a brief introduction outlining the principles behind this approach, Stout drew on his own experience of using AR to show how it can help improve classroom outcomes.
He outlined how, after identifying a problem with his particular classroom situation, he and a fellow teacher implemented changes leading to positive outcomes which could be attributed to these changes. He pointed out the need to collect multiple data sources when introducing interventions. This is essential for the teacher-researcher to better understand the influence of any changes the intervention may contribute to, and to be able to progress through the reflective cycle that is part of the action research process.
He also reminded attendees that the AR research process could also lead to academic publications or presentations, a process beneficial for both professional and learner development.
Stout then led the presentation attendees through a quick session on how to develop our own research plans. This resulted in considerable discussion and exchange of suggestions, hopefully sparking some ideas for future AR projects.

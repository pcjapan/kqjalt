He divides the video into thirteen scenes two to three minutes long.    He uses some scenes to raise student awareness of Christmas religious and secular iconography, but the activity students respond most enthusiastically to is providing dialogue for Mr. Bean’s encounters with his girlfriend.##Next, Margaret Orleans gave us several worksheets which required students to match punny illustrations with names of Christmas songs; challenged them to make new words from the letters in the phrase “Christmas Day”; find and circle 68 of them in the illustration; and “Christmas Word Ladders”—changing a given word one letter at a time through several steps to arrive at the final word provided—all related of course, to Christmas.##As well as offering some immediately usable classroom material for the coming season, this presentation was helpful in stimulating original plans by reminding us of the old familiar scenes and songs we know so well – and many of our students do not."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2008/october/11">24</a>"

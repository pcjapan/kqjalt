After distinguishing between second and foreign language acquisition he introduced several of the better-known theories in these fields and invited us to discuss them in the context of actual classroom application.  We brainstormed in groups to recall and consider a specific kind of lesson we had done or seen, and then tried to match it with a supporting theory from those he had told us about.  When some time had been spent on this, each group in turn reported their conclusions followed by a general discussion of further possible practical exploitation, and difficulties that might be encountered.####     "|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2010/april/10">85</a>"

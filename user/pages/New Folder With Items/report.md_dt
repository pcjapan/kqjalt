The inspiration came from her own example of learning a third language at school in her native Philippines and her fourth through sixth languages while serving internships or pursuing higher degrees in foreign countries.  Her advice was for students to find a practical application for their English skills in volunteer work or internships in an area of interest to them.  She gave four concrete examples:  the JALT-sponsored Teachers Helping Teachers program which operates throughout Asia, the Asian Youth Forum which meets in rotating Asian countries annually, the Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (AIESEC, an international student-led organization) internships which take place all over the world, and the Philippine Study Tour which is a joint project of AIESEC and the Bukid Foundation (which Alcazar helped establish) on Mindoro Oriental.  She walked students through the application process for each program and played video clips showcasing them."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/november/19">69</a>"

Join us for our rescheduled Kitakyushu JALT Lightning Sessions event. As our originally-planned July session was cancelled, we are going to reopen the call for presentations, and schedule this new event for November.
All members are invited to consider presenting; come and share your ideas in a friendly, relaxed environment.
We welcome presentations related to different aspects of classroom practice. We especially encourage less experienced presenters to apply, or presentations on ideas that may still be in development.

All presenters for this session will have up to 15 minutes to do their talk, with time for questions and answers at the end. 

Places are limited to a maximum of 6 presenters, so please get your suggestions in soon!

* Date: Saturday, November 11th, 6:00pm - 8:00pm
* Place: Kitakyushu Manabito ESD Station, Kokura
* Deadline for submissions: October 22nd

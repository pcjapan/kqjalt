Please note, our February 2012 meeting Developing resources for self-directed learning will not be taking place at the regular venue. Instead it will be held at Wel Tobata which is a one-minute walk from JR Tobata station (access map here). The date and starting time remain the same - 6:30 pm, Feb 11.

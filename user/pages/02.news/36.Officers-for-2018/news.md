Details of our officer line-up for 2018 are available here: http://jalt.org/chapters/kq/content/chapter-officers-2018.

There are a few changes this year, with president Zack Robertson stepping down after serving for a number of years. We thank him for his time and dedication to the Kitakyushu chapter.

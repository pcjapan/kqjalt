The project is basically a means for students in Nepal to have ongoing interactions with those in Japan through the maintenance of a shared online server (GLISS).######GLI facilitates these interactions by maintaining the server, ensuring student privacy, consulting with officials and gaining permission from the schools.  ######In a nutshell the project promotes sustainable learning by helping students in Japan and Nepal exchange ideas on how to solve problems related to sustainable development goals (SDG). For example in Japan, students might be given practical SDG problems to solve such as how everyone can get clean water, reliable electricity or take action to combat climate change. The students then have to research how to solve their problem and will then need to present their findings at the end of the school year. Throughout the project, students will be exposed to task-based English language learning activities and then will use their new language skills to interview students in Nepal via the GLISS. As well as students, teachers should also share information over the one year life of the project.  ######At the time of her presentation, the GLISS had yet to go live online and students had been using only the offline version. Once it does go online, Namiko mentioned that she hopes that the GLISS can be a place for everyone to build fun, authentic and creative activities together."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/september/11">424</a>"

The research approach consisted of interviews and surveys that targeted first and second year non-English major Japanese university students. Through this investigation he hoped to better understand his students’ impressions of online lessons in comparison with traditional face-to-face lessons.######The most surprising results were the large number favourable responses he received towards online learning. Students indicated that being online made them feel much more relaxed as it is easier to look things up during class. In addition to that, online lessons allowed them to customize their personal space to create a more comfortable learning environment. For example, students mentioned that they could have a bigger desk at home and could place snacks within easy reach whereas such luxuries are not possible in a classroom.######Another advantage was that they felt less physical exhaustion as online lessons meant that they could save time by avoiding a tiring commute to campus. This time saving allowed students to catch up on more sleep and resulted in students quickly getting used to online lessons after the first year.######Miguel also noted to his dismay that his students actually felt closer to the teacher during Zoom classes than they did to face-to-face ones. He speculated that online lessons gave students more freedom to contact the teacher directly whereas they felt more intimidated speaking up during a traditional lesson. ######Despite their overall positive assessment of online lessons, they did however express some complaints. Group work was one such area. Here, during Zoom breakout sessions where students were put into groups, they reported that it was hard to speak when there was more than one other person in the room. It was also the case that sometimes there would be a person who wouldn’t speak at all. Another issue was that they found breakout room countdown timers to be stressful and distracting.######Students liked the freedom to access on-demand video content, however these videos should not be too long. 100-minute classes for example were tiring, with 10 to 20 min videos being easier for students to maintain focus. ######Other problems from the students’ perspective included:######	Online lesson didn’t really give students many opportunities to make friends.##	Students wanted more consistency with how online lessons are taught. They had to relearn how to do lessons for each of their classes. ##	Students sometimes felt bad about communicating online due to cameras being turned off and occasional connection problems, ######In conclusion, Miguel found student attitudes to online learning were not as bad as what he had expected, however students felt that there were still some disadvantages. To overcome these disadvantages, he recommended hosting a non-educational/social online meeting to encourage team-building. Also, during breakout sessions, he recommended formalizing the roles of all participants. For example, assigning one member to become a scribe, another to be a chairperson etc. And in applying the findings to face-to-face classes, teachers could possibly make an effort to better furnish classrooms to create a more relaxing atmosphere."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2022/may/14">429</a>"

The students were all undergraduate education majors who will one day be working as educators in various subjects at elementary and secondary schools in Japan. By the end of the course Stephen stated that they should be able to produce a fully working game in a subject of their choice. Additionally they should also provide comprehensive lesson plans, rules and associated materials.########Stephen then outlined the methodology used to achieve these learning outcomes.##They first introduced a couple of games to trigger awareness of characteristics and mechanics since the more they are exposed to different varieties of games, the better they will be at creating their own original game later on.########During the semester they then concentrated on understanding and practicing one game at a time. Each game usually takes about 3 weeks and involves the following steps: First, students receive a learning feedback worksheet and a game. Then they then practice it in Japanese as homework. Afterwards he has them practice the game in English. The final step involves filling out the feedback worksheet.########Stephen and Andrew discovered a number of interesting results from their lessons. They found teaching games that do not require binary knowledge (either you know the answer or not) was a good confidence building tool as such games are more inclusive of less skilled players.########Student motivation and output was often very high however there were still some that did the minimum work. Such students would simply doing carbon copies of a game and adapt it to their topic. The highly motivated students on the other hand would surprise them by coming up with highly original games with interesting game mechanics.########As a part of their action research they conducted entry and exit surveys. Their surveys tracked their knowledge of gaming and if they thought it was a useful teaching tool. Preliminary data suggests a significant positive change in attitude over time.########They also found that students work best in pairs so that there is always negotiation and mutual support.########In conclusion they stated that this project might not always engage with all students all the time, but they felt it was nonetheless helpful with most of them. This was because they felt the activity was worthwhile at helping improve their students’ ability to plan and explain concepts better, thus supporting their future teaching careers."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/june/19">412</a>"

Such thinking is important for academia as it is the key to academic success.######Important aspects of critical thinking include: ######	Questioning skills. ##	Using and interpreting information##	Keeping an open mind##	Drawing conclusions.########Some particular cases were illustrated by Tracy. At the university in Mississippi where she teaches, she works with foreign students to prepare them for entry to the university. In the process, she has found that getting the students to apply deeper analysis has been hard to achieve. In particular, the challenge has been finding suitable syllabus, creating and adapting materials, creating projects and evaluation of results. As a first step, she thinks about what students need to know. This aids in formulating student learning outcomes (SLO) as it helps her to visualize what is necessary for the students to achieve. She then thought about a suitable mode (i.e. The tools used to educate) and what skills should they have. As a result of this planning she has carried out the following teaching projects:####Podcast project##During the podcast project Tracy had her students carry out various activities with the goal of producing their own podcast in the end. The activities she used to help them do this included an analysis of what makes a good interview, the sharing of ideas on Flipgrid, the application of technical skills and how to edit/produce their end product. Her assessment consisted of how well they applied their technical skills, their reflection of what they had produced, and whether or not they achieved the set SLO.########VR Guided Tour##For this project, Tracy had her students pretend they were tour guides. The mode used to conduct the tour was Google maps and Google Expeditions (no longer available).  ##The lessons proceeded as per the steps used for the Podcast project. However, instead of analyzing podcasts, student analyzed free online tours available from various tourist attraction web sites. Students then shared a picture of a place they like and using Flipgrid students would ask  one another questions about that place. Their final product was to narrate an online tour of their favourite places and as well as that they were free to add any music or special effects to this narration.########These activities automatically force students to think critically as it makes them consider how they should put their work together and communicate with their audience. ##In terms of assessing the activities, the presenters did not state exactly what rubrics they used but instead advised us to limit their scope as it would be too time consuming to assess all possible outcomes. ##In conclusion they presented some very useful lesson activities which are bound to make any student more engaged and thinking critically."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/may/08">422</a>"

Chelanna introduced two ideas for lessons that she found to have worked well. ########The first of these involved an idea for giving directions. Chelanna wanted to make the learning and teaching of direction-giving as fun as possible. Additionally, she also hoped to tap into her students’ nostalgia for Pokemon.########Her lesson follows the WPPP style structure (warm-up, presentation, practice, production). The warm-up activity involves a review of cardinal directions where the students  get to run around the classroom choosing to go either north, east, south or west. Maps downloaded from from pokemonpets.com, are then used to demonstrate how to give directions to specific destinations. Following this,  the whole class then practices giving directions. The production part of the activity involves student pairs participating in an information gap exercise where students need to teach the others how to get to a certain destination on their respective maps.########For Chelanna’s second activity, she explained the benefits of storytelling and how she uses it in the classroom. The aim here is telling stories in a comprehensible way by using simple English, gestures, pictures and sounds to help students learn new vocabulary and make learning more enjoyable. Students are not required to remember the words. The goal is for the students to simply understand the story - based on Krashen’s input hypothesis.########Chelanna likes to get stories from worldoftales.com and adapts the contents to match her students’ level. During the story telling she uses a prompter (list of words) to tell the adapted story. Sometimes she also provides a copy to read later. By doing this she has made story telling more enjoyable and feels that it is effective at helping learners remember vocabulary.########After a short break, we moved into the second part of the meeting, by Mark Fennelly, a professor at Shikoku University. He has been involved in the production of Ministry of Education policy materials, and teaching materials based on them. Mark gave an introduction to understanding and using the new course of study at elementary school.########In Mark’s presentation, he described the national Ministry of Education English curriculum at junior high schools and elementary schools in Japan. He also outlined problems with it, as well as changes being introduced to address these problems.########He highlighted a number of issues:########	A lot of students lack confidence in English resulting in 60% of students not interested in working overseas.##	Student performance has been lacking as per Eiken and TOEIC test results.##	In rankings based on the Common European Framework, Japan has been languishing in the “A” level.##	There has been a lack of coordination between elementary and JHS. Some elementary schools had only taught English once a week whilst some once every 3 months and therefore JHS teachers found it hard to build on the English already taught to students.##	There is a gap between the English taught at Elementary school and JHS in that the first focuses on listening and speaking, whilst the latter focusses mostly on reading and writing.########Changes to English language education are as follows:########From January 2021 there has been a change in the university entrance exam. Now students have to demonstrate how they can apply their knowledge by using critical thinking techniques with creative writing tasks. However, there is as yet no speaking test due to problems with outsourcing.########MEXT has also set a goal that students should be competent in what is described as approaches to communication. In general, this means using the knowledge of context to adapt strategies when participating in a conversation. For example, when introducing your hometown, a speaker would include different information if you were describing it to a friend in a foreign country as opposed to someone you’d like to impress. ########Another change included different types of language activities whereby students will now need to exchange their own ideas, thoughts and feelings, and not just repeat teacher-instructed expressions. In other words, students will now be expected to think about the language learned and therefore make judgments to express themselves through these language activities. The hope is for them to have a meaningful exchange of ideas by implementing skills such as greetings, shadowing, reacting, checking and asking follow-ups.########Finally, another change Mark talked about related to improvements in coordination between the different levels of schooling. Up until now, the teaching of English at the elementary level has been rather haphazard. Some students received weekly English instruction, whilst others only monthly. As a consequence, when students entered junior high school, the teachers needed to start from scratch when it came to teaching reading and writing as not everyone was on the same page. With the new system, all elementary school students will be introduced to reading and writing from years 5 to 6. All will be taught the names of the letters and be taught the basic sounds of each. They will be taught how to write from A to Z, and how to copy longer sentences. However, the teaching of phonics is not covered under these changes. With these changes in mind, JHS English textbooks will be revised based on the assumption that all students will have a basic level of reading and writing skills."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/march/13">418</a>"

For an informative speech it is important to consider what knowledge we have that our audience might want know. A persuasive presentation’s goal is to motivate the audience into action so therefore it requires information that emphasizes a topic’s benefits .####When it comes to training his students Tim outlined a number of steps that work best in his classes. At first he has all the students make groups of three and has one of them do their presentation whilst sitting down at the same eye-level. After doing this, he then has that person present whilst standing up. This gradually gets the presenter used to the unnatural change in the eye-level dynamic that one experiences during a real presentation. After these steps the student should then be ready for to present in front of a larger group.####During these exercises he helps the students to improve their timing, eye rotation and their awareness of distracting gestures.  He also encourages students to avoid a number of common presentation errors such as weak introductions (with no hook), tech failures, going over-time (as this would annoy the audience), slides with too much information, a low energy presentation styles, lack of co-ordination if it is a team presentation and a weak Q&A at the end.####Tim finished with highlighting the importance of feedback and assessment. He assesses students using the metrics “PDC 5/5/5”.##P = Preparation (Does the topic match the audience and presenter? Is the presenter familiar with how to operate the technology?)##D = Delivery (Body language and voice)##C = Content (Did they prepare enough content?

The session was divided into five parts - a TBLT definition, why it is ideal for students in Japan, problems with TBLT, an Input Task Output Task Integrated Framework (ITOTIF) definition and practical applications of TBLT.########The TBLT can be quickly defined as one that focuses first on language’s meaning rather than form. In other words, it has a strong communicative approach that allows students to try a task first before they focus on the language needed to carry out the activity. Learners focus on achieving a non-linguistic outcome that gives them a reason for communicating.########Harris gave a number of reasons as to why this sort of approach was ideal for Japanese students. Firstly, students in Japan from secondary school level have already studied a lot of language, but have had little chance to use this in communicative tasks. Also, with the test-based curriculum in Japan, the school system has set up students to fail if they haven’t studied and memorized the language in a certain way. On the other hand, task-focused lessons are more forgiving or language mistakes so long as they complete the given task. This provides students with more freedom to think creatively using the language they know and therefore results in a more motivating challenge.########In the past however, TBLT has been criticized as over-reliant on students’ current knowledge to produce language and it does not provide enough teaching input to support language acquisition. Justin suggests one way to remedy this is to make input tasks an integral step in eliciting student language output. He uses a framework based on the ideas of Jane Willis that can be divided into three stages. These include Pre-tasks, Task cycle and Language Focus. Pre-task introduces the topic, necessary vocabulary and structures. The Task cycle involves students trying the task. At the Language Focus stage, there is a reflection on the language used and practice of areas of weakness. ########Justin takes this framework and adapts it his methodology called ITOTIF (Input Task Output Task Integrated Framework). In most textbooks, Justin finds that lessons flow in the following order:########	Presentation of target vocabulary##	Grammar practice##	A production task using what students have just been learned from 1 and 2.########Steps 1 and 2 are teacher input related activities, while 3 is an output task. As an alternative to this, Justin has incorporated input and output tasks throughout the syllabus. An example of how he did this was demonstrated in a reading lesson from one of his textbooks. Usually before students read something, there might be explicit teaching of new words and/or a warm-up discussion question related to the text. The alternative approach here is to skip these activities, and instead provide students with a task of creating their own original story as the pre-reading activity. Once they have completed this, students then read the story in the text. Because the students were now curious to see how well they predicted the article’s contents, there was now real motivation for them to read for meaning. This could then be followed by a post-task comprehension check such as listing the events of the article in their correct order. Finally, as completion of the Input/Output cycle an output speaking task could be used where students talk about a topic related to aforementioned article.########In summary, Justin’s method allows for teacher-centred instruction, but prioritizes student autonomy by providing chances for the students to work with the language and think for themselves first."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2021/january/16">395</a>"

The aim here is that such situations could help learners realize the utility of foreign language to become global citizens. ####Noxon set up the class using blended technology, i.e., her class incorporate technology as the backbone of the curriculum but the technology usage is not the main purpose of that instruction. Therefore in the class, the students use computers as the medium for their English study.##Her classes are broken down into two sessions in which various tasks are assigned for students to complete. These include Listening and Speaking sessions.####For Listening, this includes face-to-face interaction with the teacher, pronunciation practice using voice recognition software from Google and listening practice using video interviews from the web site Elllo.org. With the Elllo videos, students do cloze activities and answer questions about the videos they are required to view.####For the Speaking session, students are expected to complete activities such as making presentations and speeches, doing conversation tests, doing interview tests and completing computer-based tasks. One particular computer-based task that is quite popular is using voice recognition software through Google Docs where students read a text  aloud so that Google could transcribe the dialogue. ####Additionally, Noxon discussed how it is important to teach students about digital citizenship.

He presented a wide variety of apps that are relevant for different teaching situations. ######Rab started with a comparison of current attitudes towards digital teaching tools between digital immigrants and digital natives.  Digital natives are people who have grown up in the digital age and take apps for granted, while immigrants are those old enough to remember a time before the digital age.######He related to us a number of stories demonstrating how digital immigrant educators still have outdated views of how we can use technology. It’s a problem especially in Japan. These teaching methods don’t appeal to younger students today as they have higher expectations of how to learn. Children today enjoy the freedom to use apps for everything and as a result they can do self-study with all sorts of topics that suit their interests. Unfortunately digital integration is often missing from traditional teaching methods.######The next part of his presentation outlined some theories behind how we can assess and apply different learning apps.######One theory was the SAMR (Substitutes, Augments, Modifications and Redefinitions) Model. This model helps us decide on the best teaching tool to use by posing the following questions: Does the technology not just “substitute” but also “augments” traditional media? If so, then it will be worthwhile. Are there any “modifications”  that also expand the activity? Then can we can use the app to “redefine” what the task encompasses and become more creative?######The final part of his presentation outlined a number of online learning tools and activities that could be useful for the classroom; ######Here is a summary of some of the apps introduced:######	Wallet challenge - “A” asks probing questions of a partner "B" about their wallet. Then that person has to design a better wallet and present their idea by, for example, writing a blog post about it. ##	Lextutor - You can copy and paste your work into this site and it analyses the amount and types of words that are used. ##	Analyzemywriting.com - This site can give an assessment of the writing level of your students (eg. Grade 15 = student is writing at a level of a 21 year old). It can also turn their text into a cloze exercise.##	Paperrator - You can analyze and break down the types of grammar and words and give your text a score.##	Rewordify - You can simplify a text and make it more readable.##	Purdue Writing lab - This is a web site with lots of tips and hints on writing. ##	Draftback - This app can show a student’s progression on a document as well as how they are working on it. ##	Likeso - This is an app that improves a teenager’s vocabulary.##	Hofstede-insights.com - This quantitatively compares various categories of things. ##	Feedly.com -  This app allows a teacher to keep track of all student’s blogs and the pro version allows you to do a key word search. ######The complete list can be found at the following link: http://bit.ly/Rab2020JALT-Nankyu"|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2020/january/19">407</a>"

During the talk we learned about labour standards for subcontractors/employees, insurance coverage at work, union formation rights and unlimited term contracts. ########Regarding the labour standards law he highlighted two important points.##According to article 3, Japanese and foreign workers are obliged to be treated the same. Also, part time and full time workers should be treated the same.  ########The only difference in the eyes of the law was if you are an employee or are sub-contracted. If you are subcontracted, you have no protection under the labour standards law especially in the case of being summarily sacked. Subcontractors are considered to be independent business entities so if a subcontractor loses a job then he/she needs to take the issue directly to court rather than contact the Labour Office. On the other hand the employer has no direct control over a subcontractors work. Therefore Chris warned us to look very carefully at any contract before signing in case it says “行未委託”(gyoumuitaku - subcontracting). ########Chris then gave practical examples of how the embrace of gyomuitaku has been adversely affecting teaching in Japan. He describe how most non-JET ALTs are working as subcontractors in a team teaching capacity with a full-time teacher. This is despite the fact that it is illegal for an employer (i.e. the teacher) to give instructions to a subcontractor (the ALT). He also highlighted how often companies exploit employee’s ignorance of this system by making threats that can not be carried out such as cancellation of visas or penalty fees for quitting the job.########The next part of his presentation was about the importance of social insurance and how/why companies avoid having teachers be covered by it. ########Normally full-time employees are entitled to social insurance. 50% of the insurance fees of will be paid by the employer. However the social insurance office issued a memorandum saying that a worker who does about three quarters of a full-time worker’s hours must be enrolled. So to avoid paying for social insurance companies have be deliberately restricting work hours to just under three quarters of a standard 40 hour week (29.5 hours). Employees should try to get social insurance as it offers far better long-term coverage in the case of illness or injury. ########We were then given a summary of general laws relating to work rules, firing/quitting, wages, breaks, and holidays. The details can be downloaded at the General Union web site http://fukuoka.generalunion.org/index.html. Of note was the fact that all employees are legally protected from retaliation if they wish to join a union and to participate in collective bargaining in conjunction with a union. ########The final topic of discussion covered our rights to obtain an unlimited term contract.##On April 1st, 2013 the government instituted a law that allowed for employees that have worked in a company for 5 continuous years to demand permanent transfer from their 6th year. This means that the worker’s contract will no longer have an expiry date and need to be renewed for him/her to continue working.  This law only applies from 2013 and any work prior to this will not count. Once this occurs the company are obliged to give you work until your retirement age. Unfortunately to get around this law some companies have been laying off workers for 6 months and then reemploying them. At the moment this practice is being challenged in court.########The final point Chris made was that if you feel there’s something wrong at work you should get informed and speak out. Also, joining the union offers a source of information to avoid trouble and protect from being exploited."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2020/february/08">411</a>"

The hope was that this could potentially improve his learners’ willingness to communicate.######This can occur as the videos may:######	increase personality and environment support.##	increase motivation by showing videos of peers doing the same task.##	improve cognition - if you watch other people doing it you can learn more easily.######To assess the impact of the modelling, Charlie distributed pre- and post questionnaires to his university students who were majoring in Nursing and Occupational therapy.######The questionnaires’ purpose was to determine if their willingness to communicate changed after watching the video. If it did change, how and why did it change? ######The students so far have provided mixed feedback.##Some thought that watching the video made it seem like an achievable goal and that it showed them what to do, allowing them to visualize how to do it and compare their conversations with the modelled ones. Others mentioned that their willingness to speak depended on the people in their group as well as the topic. ######On a more negative note, some students didn’t understand the contents of the videos, and didn’t like the fact that the video showed non-native speakers. ##Some simply had a negative attitude and would not be motivated one way or another. ######Charlie therefore found that video modelling can build confidence as it shows how to communicate but it is not useful for all.######Flipgrid ##Paul Collett####Paul gave a brief introduction to Flipgrid, an online video-sharing platform that helps educators see and hear from every student in class.######Flipgrid is designed specifically for educators who would like their students to create and share short videos of no more than 5 minutes. This could be for activities such as creating weekly reflective journals, debating issues, giving mini-presentations and providing summaries/reviews. ######Paul explained how he has used Flipgrid to help with assessment of a presentation skills course. He gave students iPads and then let them go away separately to record their presentations. After finishing their presentations, they would then upload them online for him to assess. ######He then went on to describe other benefits and features.##The platform allows for applying effects such as filters and emoji to the recorded content, adding a familiar aspect from popular SNS applications. The videos can be public or private. If made public, the platform has the flexibility to network with other like-minded educators who want to share videos.######Videos can be added by smartphone or from your PC. ######One major feature is that you can automatically add closed captions and download them as well, potentially saving time with transcribing what was said on each video. ######Finally, Paul talked about how user-friendly Flipgrid is. However, it is necessary to have a stable online network available in the classroom in order for the videos to be automatically upload to the cloud. ######Ideas From JALT2019##Andrew Zitzmann####Andrew talked about a number of potentially useful activities he had observed at the recent JALT international conference. ######“Flat Andrew project” - This is basically a letter exchange with other schools outside of Japan. This exchange involved the Japanese students making a paper image of themselves and sending it to a foreign school. The foreign students then took the image around town and took photos of it in various locations. Afterwards they write a report about the image’s adventures and then send it back to Japan. ######“Symbol songs” – This involves getting students to try and guess the name and lyrics of a song based on symbols on the page. ######“Greek and latin roots” – An activity where the students tried to guess and understand various words’ origins. ######Internet-Based Apps##Malcolm Swanson####Malcolm presented two apps that can be useful for gathering student feedback in large classes.######The first one is called Plickers. This app is a convenient way to efficiently gain feedback from all students and can be used for quick classroom surveys and quizzes. ##In order to do this, a teacher hands out specially-prepared cards to each student. Each card is printed with a square geometric pattern, with each side of the square labelled A to D. The teacher can then pose a question for the students and offer multiple-choice answers. The students indicate their answers by showing their cards to the teacher with the letter of their choice in the up-right position. In order to gather all the responses, the teacher uses the Plickers app on a web-connected device to scan the room, recording student responses which are automatically uploaded to the teacher’s Plickers account. This enables instant large group feedback. The advantage of this app is that every student doesn’t need to have access to a tablet or smart phone to take part.  ######The second app called Menti serves a similar function to Plickers but differs slightly in method. Instead of gathering feedback from scanning cards in a room, the teacher gets students to connect to its website, input a teacher designated code and then proceed to the quiz or survey. Once again, student feedback is instantaneous and can be broadcast in real time via the app. ######Other useful features of Menti is that it allows the teacher to create word maps and turn surveys into a quiz games. This app is available through the web site  www.mentimeter.com. ######Table-Top Gaming##Markus Yong####Markus presented a way of making complicated table top war games more accessible for young English learners as well as outlining their associated benefits and challenges. ######He used a game called Airfix Battles,  a WWII-based tactical board game. Since the game mirrors real life battles there are a multitude of rules and actions each player can take such as measuring weapons range, calculating hits, assessing damage, looking after morale and finding cover. ######Through trial and error Markus found that it is not necessary for kids to learn all the rules straight away. Instead, all that was needed was to teach the language necessary for them to move and then to shoot their units’ weapons. Then the teacher would calculate the rest. This should provide students with motivation to learn more complicated English to do this themselves in the future whilst still having fun playing the basic game.######He also found that having the kids actually make the soldiers from plastic model kits provided an extra source of motivation for when they eventually play the game."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2019/november/09">405</a>"

He found that a fixed mindset, one where natural talent is expected to succeed in language acquisition tasks, often has a negative impact as students write off language acquisition as too difficult.  It is possible, he argued to overcome this mindset through intervention.  ####Whether natural talent or learned skills is most important is greatly debated, but, what appears, he argued, to be more important is what the student believed.  He then went through the methodology he used to gauge student mindsets.  ####Using surveys and then interviews he looked at linguistic and social backgrounds as well as possible gender biases.  He suspected that there might be some limitations to the methods as there were fewer upper year students taking the surveys and students frequently did not take the surveys seriously.  ####He found that major does not correlate with mindset nor were there indicators within university entrance requirements nor overseas experience.

He began by outlining a number of terms, focusing on the difference between vocabulary size and vocabulary level. In his findings, vocabulary size was useful for distinguishing different levels of students, but, was not a good indicator of the vocabulary level of the students. And because of this, there is a tendency to overestimate student ability based simply on their vocabulary size.####He argued that some of the most effective ways to learn vocabulary include using the L1 to make connections between the two languages and also to use multiword units. His testing method started with a small group of words, with weekly tests where new words were added and tested, but, the tests would also contain words from previous lessons instead of simply testing new vocabulary lists each week. He also argued for a focus on the first 1-3000 words of the NGSL as these would be most important to the students.####In his program they took 5000 words and then translated the word list. After that, they made audio recordings of the list and through applications like Memrise, created vocabulary programs for the students. Testing generally took about ten minutes.####Finally, he outlined some of the issues in taking this approach. The introduction of a new program found some resistance from faculty and it was somewhat difficult to convince them of the use of the new program, although, in the end he was successful in bringing the program into the class. He also emphasized the need to approach the teachers and get their support before implementing a program like this. Additionally, there are technical issues to overcome as well as simple physical issues of how to get the information into the hands of the students."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2018/may/12">362</a>"

Mr. Talandis argued that since testing in English classes in schools in Japan is a fact, then we as teachers should embrace that fact and use it to our advantage. By promoting positive washback, we can turn testing into a positive experience for the students by emphasising motivation, personalized feedback and use testing to diagnose problems in the classroom.####He outlined the qualities of a good test – Reliability, Validity and Practicality. When teachers create rubrics, the teacher should ensure that the test is actually focusing on what needs to be tested – either holistically or analytically. He then gave numerous examples of test evaluation forms and gave a number of suggestions for aiding in evaluation, such as recording speaking tests and having the students evaluate each other.####In conclusion, Mr. Talandis argued that testing is an art, not so much a science, so, being creative in testing is to be valued.

For his presentation. Juha introduced the table-top game Insider and how it could be adapted to the language classroom. The game follows a simple question/answer format where members try to identify secret words by formulating yes/no questions to deduce the answer. This activity can be used in a variety of ways, however the initial explanation can be challenging to lower level classrooms.########Discussing Current Issues in the EFL Classroom, by Zack Robertson. Zack discussed both benefits and challenges of incorporating current events and issues into the language classroom. Pros included generating student interest through dynamic and relevant material that fosters learning language as a means rather than an end. Challenges included the high degree of difficulty of authentic materials, potential misunderstandings and conflict concerning sensitive topics, and risks posed by modern recording technology.########Building a School on a Shoe String, by Jason McDonald. Jason gave tips about starting a language school from his personal experience as a small business owner. His primary advice involved controlling initial costs and investment by utilizing various public resources such as community centers or private establishments such as coffee shops or restaurants. Starting this way, he argued, enables you to stay flexible, keep your profit margins higher, and better connects you to the surrounding community which helps your school grow.########19 Thoughts for a Thoughtful Teacher, by Roderick van Huis. In his presentation Roderick provided several hints to improve teacher/student relationships in the classroom. Teachers, he argued, can improve their classrooms by taking small measures to show the students they are keeping their needs in mind.

Motivation, he argued, cannot be understood as merely an emotion that an individual either possesses or does not possess but rather a complex result of competing dual-emotional systems in the brain. These systems can be described as an Approach / Avoidance duality that can either pull or push individuals into certain types of actions. These systems manifest themselves in the language classroom as students build up often conflicting emotions related to language learning, often resulting in students that can appear to be both motivated and demotivated at the same time. The key to dealing with this as a language instructor, according to Joseph, is to find ways to lower resistance towards language learning in the individual while increasing engagement in the classroom."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2017/october/14">342</a>"

Curtis explained that the mind actively makes predictions when processing the flow of a story, releasing several chemicals such as dopamine, cortisol, and oxytocin that focus attention and activate both analytical and emotional processing centers in the brain. Several studies have demonstrated that this can lead to increased performance in both short and long-term language retention compared to expository or descriptive methods of instruction. He also shared examples of how classroom activities where students generated their own short stories using presentation software led to increased motivation and self-confidence in students who did not respond as well to more traditional analytically oriented language instruction."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2017/june/10">339</a>"

He began by briefly introducing Kurt Fischer’s dynamic skill theory, a cognitive theory that postulates dynamic development from reflexes to complex systems within the human mind. According to this framework, all learning including language learning follows these principles and as such we should strive to incorporate these concepts into our language teaching approaches. In the second half of the presentation the audience was invited to choose from a short list of NeuroELT maxims and try to develop new ways they could implement these concepts in their own language classrooms. These ideas were then presented and discussed with the entire group."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2016/october/08">321</a>"

Yumiko began by stating that 10% of Japanese words are loan words, and only 6% of that 10% are English based. Looking at the different types of loan words firstly we have true cognates which have the same meaning in Japanese and English. Non true cognates include semantic changes (e.g. viking or mansion), morphological changes (e.g. stainless or ringtone), phonological (the open vowel sound 'katakana English'), or Wasei Eigo which are words unique to Japan (e.g. leiman shock or hi vision). Yumiko's findings were that literal translations lead to dangerous assumptions on the part of students. Once these errors are engrained in students' heads it is difficult to change them. In conclusion she stated that there's no shortcut to English acquisition using loan words, and keen awareness of the problems should be promoted. She instead recommended a 'katakana' of the day where the English and Japanese meanings of words such as mansion or dryer were contrasted.####Steve Paton - Freeing up fluency in a silent speaking class. In Steve's presentation he noted that students in Japan lack a usage of learning strategies. Steve divided these into Metacognitive (organising study activities, self management and self evaluation), Cognitive (repetition, note taking, deductive inferencing and linking new knowledge to old) and socio effective (used in actual communication such as 'can you repeat that?'). Steve stated that these strategies will be most effective if students understand the strategies, believe they're effective and don't consider them too difficult. He outlined a system of assessment points he uses with his students that encourages active spoken participation in class. His participation guidelines for the students were: extend your comfort zone and take risks, stay in English for the duration, communicate with the instructor in confidence, make the most of your English speaking opportunities and be outstanding. He stated that his participation system was a success and students participated much more in class."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2016/may/14">314</a>"

Andrew discussed how to address four key areas to language instruction: meaning focused input, meaning focused output, language focused learning, and fluency development. He offered a wide array of practical lesson ideas for implementing these strands in a variety of classroom settings.######Jason McDonald, Presenting Like a Boss - Hints and Tips for Great Presentations. Jason discussed several ways to improve presentations at both a formatting and organizational level. He alluded to several famous presenters and the techniques they use such as making use of props, keeping slides simple, and making sure there is a minimal amount of visible text on each slide.######Zack Robertson, We Teachers Are Weirder Than We Think. Zack talked about how language teachers bring with them certain ideas about self-esteem and achievement that we consider universal but are actually culturally informed. He went on to discuss a study held in both Canada and Japan which suggests that Japanese and Canadian students hold fundamentally different conceptions of the idea of self-esteem, which resulted in drastic differences in motivation to achieve in an experimental setting.######Markus Yong, Game Theory in English Teaching. Markus discussed the theoretical components of what constitutes a game, important aspects being voluntary, enjoyable, challenging, and containing rules or structure. He offered ideas for incorporating elements of game design into normal classroom instruction to make the activities more enjoyable for students such as integrating a story or randomization.######Stephen Case, 20 Books 20 Thoughts. For his presentation, Stephen introduced twenty books that he felt offered benefit to English teachers, both directly and indirectly. The books covered a wide variety of topics and genres, some directly related to language teaching while others were more focused on personal discovery and development.######Charles Ashley, Challenges of Teaching Pronunciation in Japan. Charles discussed some of the unique challenges facing Japanese learners in developing pronunciation skills in the English language. He pointed to several linguistic and neurological reasons for why Japanese learners often struggle with certain English sounds, and offered practical approaches to dealing with the topic in the classroom. He went on to suggest that overemphasis on pronunciation is not the best pragmatic use of time in the classroom and that we as teachers should instead remain focused on communicating as the primary focus of classroom instruction."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2015/november/14">291</a>"

He ran us through various physiological/neurological, psychological/cognitive and sociolinguistic patterns that are emerging currently in the fields of SLA, psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics, noting that individual variation resists compartmentalization, which may prejudice our teaching approaches. ##     While language development is better viewed as a continuum rather than defined through rigid age brackets, other considerations such as the Critical Period Hypothesis and puberty (both influenced by possibility versus effort) and the Reticular Activating System affect intrinsic/extrinsic and integrative/instrumental motivation. While YELLs tend to look to their teachers to provide these and often fail to negotiate meaning, older learners tend to display a wider variety of learning strategies in their language acquisition and are simply better at finding ways to supplement formal study.##     Following this intensive input was a quiz, “Who is better at what?” We answered whether children or adults were likely to be more successful at specified language learning tasks.

The split between teaching to native-speaker proficiency within the reality of non-native speaker experience was clarified by a TED clip, which pointed out that, while there are two billion people in the world presently fervently studying English, actual perfection in the language is unattainable. There is an expanding circle of non-native speakers escaping allegiance to the core and regional variants are getting increased identity. These English as an International Language (EIL) learners need intelligibility more than native speaker similitude and, as Widdowson (1994) says, English is the property of those who speak it.##     Globish is the name applied to the emerging language code evolving into a simplified lingua franca; whether it is a descriptive or prescriptive term seems to depend upon the success of those enterprises trying to market it.##     All this begged the question of which Standard English should define Globish and opened a very lively discussion to finish the presentation."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2014/june/14">256</a>"

There are four criteria: it focuses on meaning; there is some sort of information gap; learners rely entirely on their own resources-- linguistic and non-linguistic; and there is a clearly defined outcome. Some advantages of task-based learning are that students’ communicative level can be readily seen by the teacher (facilitator) and it develops second language communication skills—because in the real world students must depend on their own resources.  We then did a picture-sequencing role-play in groups to check task criteria.##	A key feature of task-based learning is that there is no pre-teaching; the pre-task just introduces the topic. The teacher helps students to complete tasks, teaching them the language they need as they look for meaning. In task-supported language teaching, on the other hand, the pre-task provides model language and the task adds meaning and form-- compromising learner autonomy for more teacher input, as with traditional PPP (Present, Practice, Produce) methodology.  ##	The presentation finished with a discussion of which approach is better suited to develop students’ communicative skills."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2014/march/08">252</a>"

In part one, he reviewed the current online reading environment, first noting how common reading online has become across many markets, while pointing out the plus and minus features of reading online.  EFL learners, for example, often do not know enough high frequency words, and the online texts can be difficult to understand.  One solution is graded readers, which are becoming more available online.  These however, pose problems such as the cost involved for the user, as well as lack of adaptability to the learner. ####In part two, Waring focused on online vocabulary learning.  After reviewing concepts important to language learning, such as the form-meaning relationship of words and the deeper meaning of words, he brought the Kitakyushu JALT attendees through different web sites devoted to different aspects of vocabulary learning.  Again, good points as well as deficiencies were pointed out. ####Waring offered his solution in part three.  It is a non-profit web site that he is creating with Charlie Brown.  The site addresses all the issues explained in the presentation.  It is helpful for writers of extensive reading texts, or for anyone creating texts for use in classes.  On the site, there are texts, leveled according to ER Foundation levels, and vocabulary learning and practice sections.  One main point is the adaptability that this site provides.  The content is free.  Teachers as well as students will have  wealth of information available for learning, teaching and research.  Waring concluded his presentation by encouraging submission of texts to the site."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/may/11">227</a>"

In this mode speakers tend to jump from topic to topic quickly and frequently (high topic turnover) with conversational listening (confirmation and engagement) overlapping the conversation.##In small groups, we simulated a “norming” session, critical to the test’s reliability, where we watched a couple of videos of paired-student conversations, discussed how to rate them and then compared with our total group.  This “socialization period” develops inter-rater reliability and rater orientation.  Step two is getting the candidates into the test room that has been set up to ensure they are accurately identified and scored.  They talk together for eight to ten minutes, followed by quietly closing the test, and evaluation.  ##Our attempts at cooperative, relative ratings gave us a good taste of the criteria involved in this essential type of assessment."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/april/13">226</a>"

Other discussion topics focused on ways in which computer mediated communication was changing the language learning process and some common types of autonomous usage and popular topics as well as the variation in the amount of English used between students at different ability and confidence levels.

Her classes begin with riddles, which is a good and fun way to get students thinking outside of the box.  (What’s a deer with no eyes?  No idea.)  This starts them thinking about words and meanings in new ways; some get the answers, some come up with new answers.  Motivation is vital; if teachers cannot maintain it, classes will fail.## ##Incorporating into the classroom the five basic types of multimedia—text, video, sound, graphics and animation--we can use technology to help students better access the English language and appreciate the existence of multiple levels of meaning within it.  At first students cannot imagine they can write poetry—but realize by the end that they are poets.  Among many examples of zany and innovative poetry on her handout is the url of a web-based concrete poetry generator and new verses generated from Love That Dog by Sharon Creech, a text designed for teaching fourth grade students in the U.S.  The handout also included compelling lists of the benefits of classroom multimedia use for both students and teachers."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/february/09">224</a>"

Scaffolding and translanguaging are vital to his method, based on a "4 C Framework" (communication, culture, context and cognition).##An eikaiwa teacher for six years, Uemura began by asking us to visualize his presentation from a learner's point of view; some are intrinsically motivated to study TOEIC, others want raises, promotions or overseas positions.  For relevance, he integrates finance and accounting into his course, defining meanings of key words in context.  As a holistic overview of his teaching philosophy, Uemura started by displaying several vocabulary items of these fields for volunteers to read and guess meaning.  He showed indistinct sketches of famous people to identify. The three-letter initials of corporate titles were displayed and we guessed what they were short for.  Tongue-in-cheek, Uemura then listed the assets and liabilities of (his) marriage to parallel such considerations with a corporate relationship (including shareholders equity)-- to introduce vocabulary and continued with a clozed written discussion of a tantalizing topic relevant to both relationships, i.e. Why can't you receive all your bonus?"|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2013/january/12">223</a>"

Some stress the importance of one over the other; neither strategy indicates a lack of knowledge per se.  ##Judith Rennels told us about setting up a Self-Access Learning Center and the challenges of translating a teacher-centered into a learner-friendly environment—sometimes making SALC activities a mandatory part of courses is the only way to ensure it gets used.  She noted how some aspects of the SALC were popular and resulted in spontaneous English usage.##Charles Ashley described his experience of “Teaching Pronunciation” in Japan where, in many classroom, the 44 English phonemes are crunched into 21 katakana ones, intonation and rhythm notwithstanding.

She came to Japan and teamed up with Hiroe Kobayashi at Hiroshima University, encountering new trends in multilingualism, with a tendency to downplay the hitherto favored focus on monolingual mastery of the target language and the realization that intercultural speakers and writers are potentially superior role models.  Attention is shifting to Vivien Cook’s (1991) notion of multicompetence (the compound state of a mind with two grammars) as a standard of evaluation. ##Results were reported of Rinnert and Kobayashi’s long-term, multi-stage research project and their implications for improving multicompetent academic writing.

Implicit language learning occurs without intentionality, without awareness (beyond the level of noticing) of what has been learned—or that it has been learned, or how.  This is how children learn their first language and their caregivers/ language teachers are providing all the input they need—without explicitly teaching them anything.  (That comes later, in school, when they intentionally, consciously, explicitly try to help students become aware of the rules of grammar they have intuitively learned.) ####Ellis encouraged us to consider the extent it is possible to facilitate the (essential) implicit understanding of a second or foreign language and its relationship with explicit instruction.  He feels that confidence in communicating comes from building up implicit knowledge and that the lack of access to it by adult learners outside the classroom must be offset by appropriate exposure to it inside, with students discovering implicit rules for themselves.

Robert S. Murphy began by comparing neurons to the reproductive system, in that excitation has to happen for transfer (of information) to take place.  Students’ emotions have to be engaged, as in the scene from Dirty Harry curiosity had to be satisfied.  Curtis Kelly followed up with an explanation of how to create a rewarding dopamine rush for students. Christopher Stillwell led an activity that simulated a cocktail party to help students realize how successful their listening can be even when they don’t understand 100% of the material.  Marc Helgesen recapped the elements of happiness--which has more to do with people’s attitudes toward life than with the number of happy events in their lives--and showed how it enhances learning.  Tim Murphey introduced the notion of mirror neurons, which are responsible for altruistic behavior, and screened a very moving appeal by his students to the Ministry of Education to improve the teaching of English.  Hayato Mine and Suguru Goto explained a system of communication using pictures that is helpful for disabled children and those on the autism spectrum.

He ran us through types and purposes of tests, pointing out that while certain high-stakes tests may rate someone as having a high level of achievement, that score does not necessarily translate into real-world fluency.  Washback, which is the students’ attitudinal reactions to testing, is a big obstacle to reliability (the replicability of testing results).

However, syntax, vocabulary and slang in children’s books are often beyond the ability level of EFL readers, thus failing to stimulate interest in recreational English reading. And summaries may be more challenging and daunting than quizzes.  Next was Accelerated Readers and in 2007 Version 1 of Moodle Reader was developed-- and implemented into the English Department in 2008.## ##Students have other priorities for their time, so reading quickly is good-- with less down time for dictionary searches, so they read more and get more exposure to lexis and syntax.  Starting at a lower and more accessible level helps break the translation habit while, hopefully, maintaining interest.  However, the bottom line is that if there is no way to check, many students will not do it.  The MoodleReader quiz program lets students complete quizzes, and teachers check them, online free of charge.  Each student has a personal page on the website that records their progress in books and number of words read.## ##Robb finished off by walking us through the simple processes for implementing this excellent tool into a school curriculum."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2011/may/14">161</a>"

We then did a typical group conversation activity (answering three questions about our names) while also taking notes on useful vocabulary and patterns that emerged.  In order to give students an opportunity to practice the language in a subsequent lesson, we designed student-centered tasks.

Simple bits of plastic marked on both sides at each end with A, B, C, and D held by each student (beside their faces so the teacher can make eye contact) keep them on-task (because a wrong answer will be glaringly obvious) and committed to their right answer, reinforced by the rest of the class display of the same answer.

One hundred billion neurons making a quadrillion connections offer potential dynamic skills development—if properly tweaked by the teacher.  It’s all about exciting neurons and building networks to bring students from their merely functional level upon entering the classroom to an optimal level with a battery of questions or similar stimuli and then continuing to generate interest and attention through emotional connections with personal, so meaningful and hence enjoyable, attractive topics.

Some difficulties are the subject matter, i.e. recognizing and avoiding taboo topics, that it is too personal or culture specific—so that some people just don’t get it-- and varying student levels, necessitating lengthy explanations that can sometimes stall the class, losing the attention of some and the interest of others so that in the end it’s just not funny anymore.

He then continued in Japanese to show how usefully the target language can be incorporated into classroom management (with TPR) to maximize student exposure to it.####Easy Steps to more English Use in the Classroom####Yukiko Arima shared some of her experience with genuine communication in Australia, noting the lack of target language use in English classrooms in Japan and citing surveys that appear to indicate that Japanese teachers simply do not feel confident enough to speak it.  She gave us a group project of brainstorming important aspects of teaching and learning under the headings of Confidence, Chance and Contents, which were then shared and discussed as part of her main focus of encouraging teachers to be confident, active learners for themselves as well as to be good examples for their students.####Teaching English in English: Easier advocated than done in Japan####As a professional teacher of English in Japan, Hiroshi Otani finds it difficult to use a lot of English in his classes.  While encouraging them to keep on trying, he described some of the major challenges that JTEs are facing in Japan, including their own command of English, the continual shifts in Monkasho curriculum requirements and the deeply rooted translation culture in this country.  Though supporting grammar explanations in the students' mother tongue and not expecting students to answer in English, Otani encourages teachers to move from explanation to activity- oriented teaching to maximize usage.  ####After these three engaging observations of the current state of English teaching in Japan and how to deal with it, brief and appropriate mention was accorded the Elephant In The Room, the University Entrance Examination, which has to change before anything else does, and then our plenary speaker gave some pointers on teaching grammar.####How to Make Grammar Easy (By First Making it Difficult!)####In the tradition of 'teacher' as 'learning assistant', Scott Thornbury showed us how he helps students discover rules of grammar for themselves by  "problematizing and personification".  He presents a language challenge in the simple quiz format of questions with multiple choice answers-- but deliberately skews the answers so that the wrong ones appear correct-- until attention is paid to the grammatical format of the question and answer, which forces students to learn from the mistakes they make.

Reading too slowly results in not getting enough information to engage the whole mind simultaneously and productively; speeding up results in more understanding because more information is immediately available to build better images to effectively process input.####A physical challenge, reading speed needs to be addressed before comprehension.  Skip the painstaking and disruptive process of looking up all new vocabulary—a lot can be understood through context if the input is fast enough to engage the whole mind.  Fifteen to twenty contacts with a word are enough to get it from short-term to long-term memory, which is the best place for it.####Introduced first at a company and then a university, Gibson’s program starts with testing reading speed and comprehension, leading to explanation and discussion of their relationship and introduction of strategies for improving both simultaneously, as well as techniques of imaging, predicting and dealing with unknown vocabulary.

If you accept Lange and Piage’s premise that we are all cultural beings and that language is the quintessential expression of culture, it makes sense to incorporate occasional translation exercises into TEFL lessons. In the Kitakyushu dialect cartoon with which we experimented, the pictures made the context very clear. Using the TRIDENT grid, we could physically measure the distance between the colloquial language of the manga and the flat and flavorless English phrases students meet in their textbooks. Working out a range of translations for various nodes on the grid has led Murphy’s students to ask important questions and feel at home with English.## ##      "|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2010/march/13">87</a>"

We pointed out that such a test was actually pointless if crammed for and underscores an endemic fixation with exam taking—but conceded that it was generally useful for job placement, and speculated upon its future in the current economic climate."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/november/14">60</a>"

Urushibara proposes that “Language Awareness” be the basis for English education in Japan, particularly when it is introduced at the primary level.  She maintains that while vocabulary is arbitrary and must be explicitly “learned”, grammatical knowledge is universal and therefore comes cost-free in principle.  She supported this notion with many examples and some technical terms-- explained to us in very accessible language.####         Urushibara stresses that English is not Japan’s second language, but a foreign language—and should be taught in the context of Japanese.   After discussing language’s shared properties, she showed ways of expressing them in various languages and then how to recognize and hence utilize our tacit knowledge of them coupled with our first language to support understanding of the target language.  She noted that unique aspects of grammar, such as word order and agreement can best be handled in terms of contrast.####         After some discussion of the relative roles of teachers and computers in language instruction, Urushibara fielded questions and remarks about our classroom experiences with and reflections upon the interrelationships of languages."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/october/10">63</a>"

However, it appears that reading and writing are not to be taught at this level.  Long-time EFL materials writer, instructor and school owner David Lisgo is concerned that teachers will be unprepared to teach the new curriculum.	Using picture cards from the Finding Out series by David Paul, and many others he has made, Lisgo gave us an evening of songs, games and activities that he has developed to introduce pre-reading and initial reading skills—and a CD full of materials to use.##	It was all hands-on and participatory; we lined up to receive picture cards and shout out what they were, or “I know, I know” to solve a riddle from hints.  We challenged our blending and segmenting skills to figure out what words were spelled from initial letters of other words (very important groundwork for learning to read and write) and our short-term memories by jumping up to identify the missing card, and we sang songs together.  (Parents are happy if you send kids home tired.)

She said that the (apparent) common wisdom of “chuck[ing] a native speaker into a classroom and suddenly it all happens,” falls somewhat short of according the teaching of oral English the kind of respect it deserves.  It needs to be recognized that spoken language has unique features quite apart from the written form—which might help dispel the thematic superficiality and one-dimensional aspect of sample conversations in many textbooks.  Having studied Japanese since elementary school, Sullivan feels well-qualified to assess methodology from “the other side of the classroom”.  She points out that sophistication in content is important-- university students are adults after all—but they have been studying EFL for so long that patterns have developed they need to break out of; they need to be pushed up to the next level and in her classes with her textbook she attempts to do just that.####Recognizing however that any textbook is just a tool to be used in the process of encouraging conversation, the latter half of the meeting was turned over to an open and lively discussion of ways and means to facilitate this,"|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/july/11">49</a>"

He led us through an introduction and sampling of a wide variety of exercises, interspersed with explanations and observations of the particular language of this medium, such as the fact that answers to Wh question words can usually be found in the lead line and that verbs are always in the present tense, with the be verb omitted in passive constructions.  ####The flu pandemic is currently topical, with plenty written about it, from which can be gleaned answers to the questions, “When do we have Stage Six?” and “When did we have Stage Six?” as well as an appreciation of how the meaning changes completely with the verb tense.  The TV schedule pages invite questions about what’s on, when, and how many weather programs there are in the mornings.  Among the input welcomed from the audience was a suggestion that students might try to guess the content of some programs from their titles—increasing awareness of immigrants about what is available to watch in their new country.####Why were there three photos of dogs on one page?  And why was one photo bigger than the others?  (Maybe because it was President Obama’s dog.)  In the before and after picture of the Hiroshima Dome, how was the before photo produced in color?  (Computer graphics.)   Why translate “Okuribito” as “Departures”?  A picture of a little girl whose parents have been deported from Japan leads to expression of differing opinions of the judge's decision.####In groups we memorized sections of Obama’s inaugural address and then performed them—which was fun, as it probably is in class.  In fact, the whole evening was a good indication of how Professor Yamanishi has been stimulating English language practice for over a decade."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/june/13">44</a>"

In a relaxed, workshop-style presentation, peppered with anecdotes from various classes past and present, they showed us many examples of their better student writing, demonstrating how important appropriate and catchy topics are, and invited us to brainstorm in groups and share our own ideas.####After establishing the basics of essay-writing with “Time Order”, “Spatial Order“ and “Description”, classes progress through genres including “Cause and Effect” and “Opinion and Reason” and a plethora of topics such as “Life As An Oil Painting” or “Hello Kitty needs/doesn’t need a mouth” or writing a note of excuse for some famously misguided historical figure.   Supplemented with audience-elicited ideas for titles on the whiteboard and a handout with examples of illustrations as subject matter these were all good reminders that there are no limits on imagination in writing – in one’s first or second language.####As had become apparent throughout the meeting, the presenters concluded that good writing topics capitalize on students' experience and interests while introducing enough parameters to demand sophisticated development of those topics."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/may/09">48</a>"

He is concerned with students missing out on the full potential of language acquisition due to a lack of the necessary support, reminding us that learning without application falls short of understanding. He walked us through the four tiers of understanding-- reflexes, actions, representations and abstractions—explaining when and how they each kick in, how they can be augmented for optimal results with “High Support Conditions”, and why ongoing assessment is the only worthwhile form of assessment. (Everyone has good and bad days.) Many commonly accepted psychological truisms were entertainingly debunked—excepting that believing something made it true.####A simple diagram illustrated how three developmental archetypes-- Linguistic Structures, Nonverbal and Cultural Manifestations, need to be balanced for good L2 performance—and how overemphasis on the former is counterproductive. Self in Relationships (SiR) interviews showed that father and teacher roles (which demand arbitrary filial respect) are the ones viewed most negatively by students in Japan. “Consciousness raising maps” - grouping of terms and assigning of emotional valences to them, help students focus on Performance of Understanding—entirely in English."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2009/april/11">47</a>"

Tenth-grade students in groups of 4-5 choose a topic—not necessarily related to traditional culture—and take on the roles of manager, director, designer, and writer(s) in order to plan a video in which all of them will have speaking parts and which will be judged on the basis of originality, communicativeness, and fluency.  Pite shoots and edits the videos at the end of a seven-week term and the best ones become a 45-minute Culture Video Festival shown during a grade-wide assembly.####           Showing copious clips from his eleven years of utilizing this project, he pointed out possible pitfalls and explained how he deals with them.  The walls of the meeting room were decorated with posters and other student-produced visuals, and we received handouts of the planning and evaluation forms he uses.

Directed by the school administration, they were initially unsure of what to do to implement these objectives, beyond recognition of the importance of increasing motivation through the integrated teaching of four skills and encouraging creative use of English with other subjects, as stipulated by the Ministry of Education.  ####This latter goal was not shared by teachers of other subjects at the onset of the project, but changed dramatically as it developed, along with the attitudes and methodology of those directly involved, something appreciated as one of the most important and apparent benefits of the program.  Grammar translation methodology gave way to practically exclusive use of English by teachers as well as students.####Games and strategies to extend and fine-tune conversations— such as encouraging immediate responses and following the formula,  A(nswer)A(dd)A(ask)-- are used extensively in the program   Debate was introduced as a powerful means of facilitating oral expression.

While podcasting in the classroom is appealing as a technological route to educational benefit, careful consideration must be made of how to apply it; teachers must clearly identify their course goals.  Students’ social and interactional needs and common challenges associated with group project work must also be kept in mind when designing and implementing podcast projects.  ##Sullivan exploits the podcasting process of plan/practice, record/edit, broadcast and listen/feedback for pedagogical processes, repeated several times, to support a consciousness-raising, reflective approach to engaging with spoken English in a supportive classroom environment.  ##After polling her audience to determine the extent of our experience with podcasting, Sullivan, who has been studying a foreign language (Japanese) herself since junior high school, gave us her rationale and procedure for making a lot more listening materials available on-line than there had been for her, showing how the challenge of making something that people will listen to helps students get satisfaction from doing something authentic using English.##Sullivan’s goals for Oral Communication classes of getting students to talk, keeping them on-task and attending to fluency and pronunciation would seem to be well met by this project.

The other automatically becomes their second language of study.    The institute has devised a 70-minute online, computer-scored placement test of receptive skills that automatically assigns students to one of four levels of language courses as their starting point.  The main difficulty is students who deliberately do worse on the test than they are capable of, in an attempt to slide by in an easy course, so adjustments are made in about ten percent of the assignments.##	For students who have been educated in an immersion program, there is a competency test to assess productive skills as well.  Again it is machine-administered, but the recorded speaking and writing samples are assessed by two raters.  The department continues to refine this part of the exam.  Although computer-based tests are cheaper and faster to administer, poorer students are not as well discriminated by such tests.  ##	The university is currently beginning a longitudinal study, in which they will administer exit tests as well, to measure achievement.  In addition, to discriminate better among students at the borderline between high placement students and low competency students, they want to devise a tailored test, where students can take a ten-minute test and then be routed to either the placement or competency test, so they are trying to find shorter but equally effective writing and speaking tasks.  They have tried letters and second paragraphs of the traditional five-paragraph essay, and are now looking at using the same theme for both the reading and writing questions in order to streamline the test while increasing its effectiveness.  They are also introducing a very short grammar section with high discrimination."|"<a href="/chapters/kq/schedule/2008/november/06">22</a>"

Everyone was reminded to save digitalized versions of any special materials they prepare for a course.##	When the discussion shifted to extensive reading, Hudson Murrell passed out a description of his program.  About half those present used some form of extensive reading.  Most agreed that it works best as homework, at the pace of one book every week or two.  It can be supplemented by in-class instruction in reading strategies (such as how to handle unknown words) and even by the teacher reading aloud to make clear to the students that there is no pausing or backtracking in this type of reading.

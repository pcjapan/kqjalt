## Chapter Officers for 2018

<p>The following candidates are standing as chapter officers for the Kitakyushu JALT chapter for the 2017-2018 executive period.

<h3>Membership Chair</h3>
<h4> Charlie Bell </h4>
<p>I'm interested in becoming membership chair, firstly because I think it will be a good step towards expanding my career prospects in Japan; learning more about ELT in Japan and meeting new people; and secondly it gives me an opportunity to share some of my own, new ideas with the head honchos in KQ.
<br />
<strong>Bio Details:</strong>I come from Reading, UK. I've been teaching in Japan for about 4 years, first as an ALT, then in an eikaiwa and at a private university. I'm currently studying for an MA in TESOL at Birmingham university in my spare time, and I'm loving it. I have been the membership chair for the past year and it has been a great experience, I have met some fantastic people and learnt a lot more about ELT in Japan. I would be more than happy to continue in my role for another year.

<h3>Program Chair; Internet Services Manager</h3>
<h4>Paul Collett</h4>
<p>
Outgoing Program Chair Robert Murphy has already lined up some excellent speakers for 2018. In addition to these, I will ensure that we have a full, varied, and stimulating program that should appeal to the wide interests of our membership.<br />
As for the Internet services manager position, I will continue to ensure the chapter website functions properly and that we are able to get information about our chapter and events online in a timely manner.

<strong>Bio Details:</strong> Instructor at Shimonoseki City University. I have been a member of the chapter for more than 15 years, and have maintained the chapter's internet services for a number of years.

As well as maintaining the Kitakyushu chapter website, I take care of the JALT national site at http://jalt.org, alongside other duties.</p>

<h3>Publicity Chair</h3>
<h4>Jason McDonald</h4>
<p>
As PR Chair, I have been responsible for communicating upcoming events and other information to members. Additionally, I have prepared the member's business cards and yearly flyers. From time to time I have also passed along information from other chapters and various bits of interest. While our Twitter account has seen very little traffic, I have still kept track of that as well.

<h3>Treasurer</h3>
<h4> Juha Vaittinen </h4>
<p>
I would like to continue working as the Kitakyushu JALT Treasurer because I believe I have the necessary experience and skills to safeguard the chapter’s finances. As the chapter treasurer for 2016-2017, I gained invaluable insight into the inner workings of JALT at both local and national level. Since taking up my treasurer duties a year ago, I have represented the Kitakyushu chapter at the JALT EBM last June and volunteered as an assistant treasurer at JALT PanSIG 2017 conference in Akita, which I intend to do next year as well. I have been a regular at Kitakyushu JALT meetings for over two years now, and I know and get along well with all members who frequently attend the chapter’s events.
<br />
<strong>Bio Details:</strong> After graduating from University of Eastern Finland with a master’s degree in EFL education, I moved to Japan in 2011 to work on the JET Programme as an assistant language teacher. After four years as an ALT and a year as the JET Prefectural Advisor for the Kitakyushu board of education, I have been working part-time at three universities, ALC, and a private English school.

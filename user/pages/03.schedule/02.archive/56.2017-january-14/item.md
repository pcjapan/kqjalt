This presentation will review two websites: http://genderfluency.com  and http://goldfish365.com. The first is designed to both present the findings regarding the fluency and dysfluency of gendered interactions and to show the importance of closely examining videos and transcripts of Japanese L2 interactions. Second, data of Japanese students’ fluency variables and acoustic, lexical, and syntactic dysfluency variables will be compared to native speakers’ to highlight the most important issues that teachers need to focus on in class. Third, data will then be discussed concerning how students performed in EFL gendered and then in same-sex interactions. Fourth, the results of a pre- and post gender interaction survey will be presented briefly to highlight how student attitudes to such interactions changed over three weeks. Finally, the results about students’ grammatical accuracy in spontaneous discussions will be covered so that teachers know what errors and issues need to be addressed in the classroom.
In the second part, Jose will discuss the development of his website Goldfish and the benefits and issues of online EFL learning specifically fluency practice. After covering the topics and tasks that his site provides, he will then provide some information about how this form of learning has worked with his own students.  Time at the end of the presentation will be given for very interesting and challenging questions.
José Domingo Cruz is the Chief Creator for several English study projects, including his newest venture, GoldFish. José is originally from Canada, a long-term Japan resident and a veteran university instructor
Robert William Long is a 25 year veteran in teaching ESL and EFL. and is currently an Associate Professor at Kyushu Institute of Technology.

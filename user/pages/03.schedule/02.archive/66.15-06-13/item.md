Using Bell's Technology (or Innovation) Adoption Lifecycle theory, this presentation will be allow attedees to reflect on elements of their current teaching situations and practices, based on an understanding that the model describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined user categories. Using a workshop style format, attendees will self-identify personal or institutional stages of acceptance and adoption of various teaching methods and approaches, and consider the efficacy and perceived costs/benefits of such approaches.

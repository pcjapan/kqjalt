Our October 8th meeting will be a short presentation night, so everyone who comes should bring along a 20-slide presentation related to language teaching or learning, timed to change every 20 seconds, on a thumb drive. For more information on the planned format, start with this link: https://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/09/pecha-kucha-and....
As we need a general idea of how many presenters to expect, please contact us in advance if you are planning to attend. Please send your name and Pecha Kucha presentation title to kitakyushu@jalt.org.

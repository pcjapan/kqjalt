This presentation consists of three interrelated sessions. Initial discussion will centre on a deeper exploration of what is meant by the term English Circles, and will reveal the increasing importance of English as a lingua franca (ELF) interactions to the learner. The next will explore how globish, as an emerging language code, is helping to fill the communicative functionality gap between NNS interactions, and reveals the systematic trend towards greater clarity of expression. The third session will then allow participants to discuss the standard they teach, and also to explore specific in-class ELF-centric issues.

This session will cover a range of current best practices in digital pedagogy, with practical examples drawn from a number of pedagogical approaches to learning and related apps. These will all be demonstrated with examples from the presenter's own classes, showing how a range of apps can be combined in an app-smashing way to maximise educational benefits. However, this session will not just be a typical 'how to use apps' type workshop. The benefits to students in terms of their improved mind-brain learning as a rationale behind the adoption of these apps will also be covered, as will the motivational benefits for students that challenge / project-based learning brings. Everything will be demonstrated in an easily-understood way, making for a session applicable for educators no matter what the range of their edtech skills. After the initial overview and demonstration, the session will become more hands-on, with the presenter working directly with attendees to demonstrate how to set up and use the apps under discussion. The workshop will end with a more traditional Q and A session, although attendees are free to ask pertinent questions throughout the session.

After a year of presentations, events, and conferences, now is a great time to reflect on your presentation styles and approaches. What are your ways to capture your audienceâ€™s attention? Are you using your slides efficiently? How do you end your talks memorably?
In this session, the speaker will introduce and demonstrate essential skills and approaches that can be applied immediately to improve presentations of a variety of levels and settings. Together, we will explore multiple ways to introduce and conclude a talk, as well as become more aware of common downfalls some speakers habitually find themselves attached to. Overall, this session will help you be able to share your ideas and connect with the audience in more effective and impactful ways. The elements discussed will also be applicable to students who are learning about foundational presentation skills. Students and teachers of presentation classes are highly encouraged to partake in this session.

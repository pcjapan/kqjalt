In this workshop, the presenter will demonstrate how portfolio assessment plays an integral part in his communicative English courses at a Japanese women's university. Participants will experience tasks and activities that will enable them to successfully develop their own grading rubrics, coordinate peer assessment, and learn why shared accountability improves language acquisition based on interactional theories of language.
Creating portfolios provide students with the chance to learn the skills of reflection, self-evaluation, critical thinking and independent learning. Portfolios can be used in a variety of teaching situations to promote student generated experiential learning.

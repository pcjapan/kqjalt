This presentation examines the development of English and Japanese academic writing ability among Japanese EFL writers. The presenter will share results of a long-term, multi-stage research project involving participants at various levels of language and writing proficiency, ranging from high school to post-graduate writers in L1 and L2, most recently adding L3 (Chinese, French or Spanish). Pedagogical implications will be drawn regarding ways to help students become better academic writers across languages.
Carol Rinnert is a Professor in the Faculty of International Studies, Hiroshima City University.

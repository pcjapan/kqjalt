This presentation will first review some of the underlying principles of foreign language vocabulary acquisition. It will then look at how well course books and other ELT materials cover the most important vocabulary and whether they adhere to these underlying principles. Participants are asked to bring any current EFL text they are using to show others and review in light of the above principles.

This presentation looks at different ways tasks can be used in classrooms to improve L2 speaking in terms of fluency, accuracy and complexity. The talk first discusses what fluency, accuracy and complexity are, how they can be measured, and issues relating to them as aspects of L2 speech proficiency. Different methodologies for using oral tasks are then examined by comparing task-based language teaching with task-supported language teaching. Finally, examples are provided to show how narrative tasks can be designed and sequenced to elicit learnersâ€™ use of grammatical structures involving relative clauses.

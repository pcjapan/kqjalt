Learn more about Japan from your students while stimulating meaningful communication in apparently fluent English.  (Teacher tweaks the video with iMovie software.)  This presentation will explain how first-year high school students are encouraged to plan, organize and present some coherent and entertaining descriptions of Japanese culture.  Selected videos will be shown.
After teaching ESL/EFL in Mexico, Victoria, Quebec and Greece, Dave Pite has been in Japan for many years, first with Language Resources at Kobe Steel and other companies, then various universities, culture clubs and playschools prior to joining Meiji Gakuen Junior and Senior High School.

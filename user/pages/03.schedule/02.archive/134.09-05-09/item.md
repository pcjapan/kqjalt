In a workshop setting, the presenters will explore topics that stimulated the best writing from their high school students and analyze the factors that characterize the best topics, illustrating their findings with examples of student writing and comparing them with the results of a simple student survey. Participants should bring along some successful topics to share.
Margaret Orleans has been teaching English in Asia for over twenty years. Itsumi Ohmura loves drama and hopes to teach it in English. She has taught in both public and private secondary schools in Japan. The two of them team-taught an Advanced Writing course at Meiji Gakuen.

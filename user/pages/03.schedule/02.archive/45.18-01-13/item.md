School systems typically push students up the grade levels each year (based on age), assuming the students have mastered what has been taught the previous year. However, research in neuroELT clearly shows us that all students’ learning varies widely; a significant portion of our students should not be forced into the next level simply based on age-based assumptions. In this presentation learn about authentic student voices regarding this “automatic escalator system”. You may be surprised by the young students’ insights! Several practical solutions from neuroELT will be discussed, too.

There is growing evidence in support of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that the language(s) we use influence our conceptual knowledge and so our perceptions of reality (Pavlenko, 2014). If language shapes our concepts, L2 words are linked to an L1 word-concept, which may show varying degrees of dissimilarity to the L2 word-concept. This is problematic in classroom situations where students must learn the meaning of L2 words through translation, definition, and/or reading or hearing the new words in co-text. Without the wider context of the socio-cultural reality words simultaneously refer to and depict, it might not be merely difficult for L2 learners to achieve native-like language competence, but impossible. We will reconsider what is involved in learning a foreign language and the implication that focusing on English as a lingua franca may not only be desirable for practical purposes, but also to create an achievable aim for classroom learners.

This talk will begin by briefly examining the following distinctions: (1) implicit vs. explicit learning, (2) implicit vs. explicit knowledge and (3) implicit vs. explicit instruction. It will examine the significance of these distinctions for language pedagogy by addressing the following questions:

How can teachers cater to ‘implicit learning’ in classroom instruction?
How can teachers cater to ‘explicit learning’ in classroom instruction?
What role does ‘explicit learning/ knowledge’ play in L2 learning?
What constitutes an appropriate balance between implicit and explicit language instruction in a language curriculum?

The talk concludes with examples of how ‘tasks’ can be used to construct a curriculum that maximises opportunities for students to develop their implicit and explicit knowledge of a second/foreign language in a classroom context.

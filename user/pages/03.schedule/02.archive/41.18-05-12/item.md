This presentation first describes the beneficial features of a hypothetical program of vocabulary study. These features include spaced rehearsal, adaptive learning, increasing retrieval difficulty, the use of an appropriate word counting unit, the presentation of both audio and orthographic forms, the use of context, and the use of the learnersâ€™ L1. Findings in the research literature on vocabulary learning are easy to understand, yet difficult to apply to a vocabulary program in practice. As a result, vocabulary programs often fail to help students reach their potential. The second part of the presentation describes the challenges faced, the great assistance received and steps taken when the presenter piloted, created, and administered an institution-wide research-informed vocabulary program.

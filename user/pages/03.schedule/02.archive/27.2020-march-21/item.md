This event has been cancelled due to concerns about the spread of the corona virus. We will try and reschedule
Personal finance is the cornerstone of a comfortable life. If you have good money habits and knowledge you will be able to enjoy your life and spend your time doing interesting and productive things. If you have bad money habits and knowledge you will probably not enjoy your life and will spend a lot of time worrying about money. This session will go through a rapid-fire series of practical personal finance principles and tips for residents of Japan, followed by a question and answer discussion session. This is a new workshop format so should be useful even if you have attended a RetireJapan seminar before.
Come with questions, leave with new ideas and answers.
Ben Tanaka (Shearon) is a university lecturer from Sendai. He has been teaching English in Japan since 2000, and running the RetireJapan website since 2013.

Although widely-used throughout the social sciences today, the Grounded Theory methodology (GTM) has been frequently misused by researchers in Applied Linguistics and related fields, leading some to question its suitability. This presentation dispels some common misconceptions about GTM, and explains the procedures, purposes, relative strengths, and unique weaknesses of the methodology. Resources and dispositions vital for successful research completion will be discussed. When used in an appropriate and informed manner, GTM can support research, and stimulate new insights related to human discourse and social interaction.

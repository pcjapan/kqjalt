Every teacher has certain principles, be they based on theory or developed through teaching/learning experiences, which shape their classroom decisions. The presenter will introduce the teaching/learning principles she believes are crucial for oral communication courses and will discuss how they were incorporated into the oral communication textbook Impact Conversation 1 & 2 (Pearson Longman) and how she applies them in her own classes.
Kristen Sullivan is a lecturer at Shimonoseki City University where she teaches Academic English, TOEFL, Composition and Oral Communication. She is co-author of the oral communication textbook Impact Conversation published by Pearson Longman.

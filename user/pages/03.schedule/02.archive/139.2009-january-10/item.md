Recent technological advancements are not only influencing our personal and work lives, but are also making waves in the world of education. The terms blogging, wiki-ing, podcasting, and vodcasting may still be unknown to some students (and teachers), but they are being seriously considered by language teachers around the world for application in the classroom and use in self-access learning. Podcasting is one concept that many oral communication teachers are experimenting with. Podcasts, and other forms of online listening, provide a wide range of authentic and pedagogically-driven listening materials for use both in and out of the classroom. And with the necessary tools, students can even make their own podcasts. This presentation will consider the latter notion of podcasting – student-authored podcasting – and will discuss the pedagogical and social benefits, and potential pitfalls, of incorporating podcasting into classroom activities. Through a discussion of her own experiences of using podcasting in the classroom, the presenter will consider the pros and cons of classroom podcasting, the necessary stages before beginning a podcast project, and several ideas for designing podcasting activities. Participants will also be encouraged to think about possible uses of student-authored podcasting in their own classroom settings.


Kristen Sullivan is a Lecturer at Shimonoseki City University. She is interested in the use of technology for educational purposes in and out of the classroom, and has conducted numerous classroom research projects involving online listening and student-authored podcasting. She is co-author of the oral communication textbook Impact Conversation recently published by Pearson Longman.

The presentation will describe what exactly a game is and why they are fun. In particular there will be a look at self determination theory and motivation. There will also be a discussion on game design and how this can be applied to any activity through the process of gamification. In the final part I will show how I applied gamification to a university level TEFL classroom and discuss my preliminary results.

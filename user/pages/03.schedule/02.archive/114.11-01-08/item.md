 Want to improve your memory!? What about your students’ memory? Robert will discuss provocative new discoveries in brain research, memory, and learning. The content, stemming from his research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is cutting-edge yet highly practical! There will be a good balance between theory and fantastic hands-on applications. CREAME pedagogy and “Teaching for the DATC” will be thoroughly covered in the presentation.

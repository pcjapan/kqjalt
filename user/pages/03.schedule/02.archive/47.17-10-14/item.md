Many teachers complain about demotivated students. We will see, however, that common ideas about motivation are at odds with recent insights in cognitive neuroscience. Negative attitudes are a normal (though not desirable) part of foreign language learning. We will discuss a new approach to student engagement based on the notion of linguaculture learning and emergent motivation. This talk will be interactive and not overly technical. Participants will have have the chance to share their thoughts and experiences.

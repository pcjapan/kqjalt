This month, we're going to give some time to talk about topics that merit discussion, but haven't had their own program recently. There will be something for everyone! If there's a topic you'd like to discuss, let us know or bring it along.

Extensive Reading—ER is becoming more and more popular, and lots of people have been experimenting with it. Have you set up or run a program at your institution, or incorporated into your courses? Come tell us how your program is structured and how it's working, and if you're thinking about starting one, come learn how others have done it.
Throwing away the textbook—We've all run into the limitations of textbooks....and sometimes courses can work well without them. Have you done classes without a text? How did it go? What have your experiences been with replacing texts with your own materials and ideas? Please share your experiences and suggestions.
Ongoing or planned research projects—What kinds of research are you doing, or what are you interested in? Is there any area for collaboration between members? What are we finding, or hoping to learn, from our research? How can our local chapter assist our members with their research - or how can JALT as a national body assist us?

This month we have another instalment of our popular annual Lightning presentations. There will be a number of presenters who will each take turns presenting their chosen topic using only 20 slides for 20 seconds per slide. This creative event promises to be a rewarding experience for all involved where people can have fun sharing ideas and thoughts about their classroom experiences and research. 
The sessions we have lined up to date are:

Jason McDonald - Presenting Like a Boss - Hints and Tips for Great Presentations
Stephen Case - 20 Books 20 Thoughts
Andrew Quentin - 16 Communicative Classroom Activities Using the 4 Strands
Charles Ashley - Challenges of Teaching Pronunciation in Japan
Zack Robertson - We Teachers Are Weirder Than We Think 

Presentations start at 6:30 on the 8th floor of the Wel Tobata building, room 82.

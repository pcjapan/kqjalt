 More and more ESL teachers in Japan are  discovering the advantages of involving their students in an  active reading program, rather than just  leaving it to the students as homework. This  presentation will cover the presenter's experience with  setting up and using reading programs in companies and  universities. Materials, program control, motivation  and results will be discussed and expanded on freely at the  end of the presentation.
Ken Gibson has been involved with corporate training  and university eduction in Japan for over 20 years. He  is currently teaching at The University of Kitakyushu and  Kyushu Polytechnic College.

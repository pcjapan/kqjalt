With mobile technology ubiquitous among university students, students can use their mobile devices' built-in video cameras outside of class to create videos narrated in English. This brings the language theyâ€™ve studied in their coursework into a familiar context. They could, for example, describe their neighborhood, or introduce their hobby. When they bring these videos into the classroom to show to classmates, this serves as a catalyst for highly personalized conversations. In this presentation, I will discuss the types of assignments given, demonstrate a technologically simple way to collect these videos, and explain how these assignments were expanded through in-class tasks.

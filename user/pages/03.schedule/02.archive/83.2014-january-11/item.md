Practical and theoretical! Robert will discuss content from the best presentations at the Mind, Brain, and Education conference in Quito, and the ICCNS conference in Boston. He will also present the 42 Maxims from the neuroELT lab in their newest form. Finally, in a workshop format, participants will be working in groups to design practical ideas for their own classroom contexts. Be prepared to take home a notebook full of new ideas!
The meeting will be in room 83, Wel-Tobata

Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) is a pedagogic approach to develop L2 learners’ communicative competence by focusing on both teaching subject and language. However, there has been little research on implementing CLIL in TOEIC courses, as TOEIC mainly tests learners’ business English proficiency. First, the presenter will explore theoretical framework of CLIL and its effectiveness in TOEIC vocabulary teaching. Then, he will demonstrate a TOEIC vocabulary seminar applying CLIL. The teacher plays a role as both language teacher and content teacher by making the most of his former experiences.
Takashi Uemura is an MA student in TEFL/TESL at the University of Birmingham. He taught English conversation and English proficiency test preparatory courses at one of the major Eikaiwa schools in Japan for 6 years. Before teaching, he worked as an auditor at an international audit firm and also in finance and banking field for approximately 10 years.
The meeting will be held in room 82 at Wel-Tobata, see the location page for access details.

Collaborative testing (CT) involves learners, working in pairs or small groups, taking tests together. Learners have to negotiate and agree on the same answers. Collaborative testing claims to offer learners the chance to discuss their reasoning, fill in knowledge gaps, develop interpersonal skills and enhance understanding. This talk presents data from questionnaires on how the confidence level of students influences their perception of taking tests collaboratively. It also looks at whether or not students in general have favourable or unfavorable views towards taking tests with a partner. It provides insight into whether or not it is a feeling universal to all students, or whether or not there is a difference in perception towards CT depending on the students own confidence or anxiety towards testing, pair work and communication. It gives recommendations on how to test students with different personality types communicative ability, without increasing anxiety and creating an impression of unfairness.

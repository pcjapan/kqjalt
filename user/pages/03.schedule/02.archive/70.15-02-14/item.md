(1) Creative Variations for Textbook Conversations 
Bill Pellowe
Most English textbooks contain model dialogs and conversations for students to practice. In this workshop, the presenter will demonstrate a wide variety of techniques and approaches for using these textbook dialogs in the prelistening, listening, practice and postpractice stages. This aims to be a practical and useful workshop on adapting and extending these traditional activities.
(2) Assessing Gains in Extensive Reading 
J. Lake, Bill Pellowe
This presentation explains the benefits of developing autonomous readers through an extensive reading program, where students read many interesting books at an appropriate level of difficulty. Students and teachers made use of an extensive reading module for an open-source audience response system. Using this system provides autonomous active learning conditions in an extensive reading program as part of the reading curriculum. Additional empirical data will also be presented to show how extensive reading leads to gains in reading speed, reading motivation, and a positive reading identity.

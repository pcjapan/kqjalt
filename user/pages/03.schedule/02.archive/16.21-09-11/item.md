There is a strong disconnect between how English is still taught in schools, and its prevalence as an international language in our interconnected digital world. Moreover, many young adults lack confidence and a voice, often detached from issues in Japanese society. Are our traditional approaches to English language instruction preparing our learners to become active and global participants of the “Experience Age”?
The presenter hopes to inspire foreign language teachers through a one-year, hybrid, cross-cultural (Nepal-Japan) SDG program. The framework can be implemented in any secondary school to involve our learners to become autonomous thinkers in an ever-evolving, multilingual world.
Namiko Tsuruta has taught for 23 years in Kanto and trained Japanese teachers and ALTs in schools for many years. She is a graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall and the University of Michigan. She is currently Program Director of Global Language Institute and Creative Director of The Tokyo Life.
This meeting will br taking place over Zoom. Please contact us if you would like the link.

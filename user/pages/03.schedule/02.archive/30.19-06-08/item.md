What is the role of the teacher in the Age of Information when the tools of learning are at students' fingertips?
Take a peek inside a student centered classroom of a semi-self-organized learning environment. The integration of educational technology is still being pioneered in education. This presentation will share several free online learning platforms, and their implementation in a semi-autonomous mixed level, mixed aged English learning environment.

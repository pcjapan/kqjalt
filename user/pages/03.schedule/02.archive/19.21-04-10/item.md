In this talk, the presenter will provide tips for training activities, syllabus design, common mistakes, and both teacher and peer feedback on studentsâ€™ presentations. While the focus will be on how to teach a university presentation skills course, it should also be useful for teachers of any level who incorporate student presentations into their English classes.

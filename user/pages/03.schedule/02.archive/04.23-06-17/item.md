The presentation is an extension of two previous presentations. The focus of this presentation is to explore the practical application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in language instruction, specifically using ChatGPT and other applications.


During the presentation, we will discuss a planned collaboration between the English teachers at Nagoya University of Arts. This collaboration will involve creating supplemental follow-up activities based on the language and text of each unit of our chosen textbook. We will also explore ideas for meeting individual students' ability levels, needs, and interests.


Many teachers are concerned that students can use AI to complete traditional classroom tasks without actually learning the material. Therefore, we will emphasize creative and critical thinking, live interaction, and real-time performance to avoid overreliance on AI and encourage students to demonstrate their learning.


Furthermore, we will discuss how AI can save teachers time and effort by creating lesson plans and individualized assessments, including Google Forms-formatted quizzes and feedback on student essays. We will also share some available tools and resources and explore the near future of AI in language education.


Join us as we delve into the exciting world of AI and its potential in language education. Let's get a piece of our AI pie!

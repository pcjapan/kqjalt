A practical, theoretical, and fun presentation! What does neuroscience have to offer to EFL teachers? Find out fascinating new developments in neuroscience that have been translated into practical classroom pedagogy. The presentation will be broken into three parts: (a) discussion of the newest neuroELT findings from our neuroELT lab at the University of Kitakyushu; (b) hands on demonstration of highly effective neuroELT activities for child and adult classrooms; and (c) time for creating your own action plan.
This meeting will be held at the Kitakyushu Shoko Boeki Kaikan, room number 603. See here for a map http://www.syoukou-boueki.jp/1-2-shozai.html. It is a 10 minute walk from JR Kokura Station. Or, take the monorail to Tanga Station (the second stop from JR Kokura) and you'll find it right in front of the station. There's no free parking, but you can find coin parking in the area.

Although Christmas may still seem a long way off, it's never too early to start preparing for the day! This month we have a couple of activities guaranteed to bring some seasonal cheer into the classroom, as well as help your students gain a better understanding of the whole Christmas experience.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean
Find all the Christmas iconography in the short video Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean. Determine which icons are religious and which are secular. Create a narration and dialogue for the silent film.


Christopher Carman teaches full-time at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health and part-time at the University of Kitakyushu.

Illustrated Christmas Carol Titles

 Match the punny illustrations with the names of traditional and offbeat Christmas songs. There's no need to be familiar with the songs themselves for this activity.


Margaret Orleans teaches at Meiji Gakuen Junior/Senior High School.

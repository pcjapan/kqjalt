In this presentation the speaker will discuss literacy differences between male and female students at the elementary level and the implications this has for performance in the language-learning classroom.  I will cover how this meshes with current pedagogical and feminist theory.
Michael Berg has been in Japan for 9 years and has experienced teaching learners at all levels. He currently teaches at Kitakyushu University, Shimonoseki City University, and Kyushu Sangyo University.
The meeting will be held at our regular venue, Wel Tobata, starting at 6:30 pm in room 82. Admission free for JALT members, 1,000 yen for nonmembers.

The aim of this presentation is to introduce a computer program that produces a modifiable card game that can be used in some English classes as a vocabulary builder and to strengthen lexical recognition.
Research and analysis of the efficacy of this vocabulary game, and any future directions of this project will be discussed. Afterwards, there will be an opportunity to try the game, to ask questions and to give feedback on it.
Adam Stone teaches at a number of schools in the local region. He is currently completing his masters degree.

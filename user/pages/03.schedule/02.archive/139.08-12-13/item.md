Join us for our annual year-end/Christmas party. Chat about the year gone, and the year ahead, in an informal setting with other chapter members. We'll provide light snacks; please bring a bottle of something you'd like to drink and share with other attendees. Bring a friend, too!
We will also be running a book swapâ€”a great chance to clear some space off your bookshelves, or find something new to read over the New Year break.

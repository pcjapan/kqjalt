Getting students to use the target language during communicative activities can be challenging for teachers. This presentation will discuss some of the common issues teachers face when implementing communicative methods, and inform how the correct sequencing of tasks can lead to greater learner participation and understanding in communicative tasks. The second half of this presentation will be a workshop; giving participants the opportunity to design a sequence tasks for use in their own classroom.
Charlie Bell has worked as a teacher in and around the Kitakyushu area for the past five years and currently teaches at a private English school as well a number of local universities. He finished studying for an MA TESOL with Birmingham University in 2018.

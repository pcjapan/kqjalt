Games, with their rules and repetitiveness, provide the perfect scaffolding for language practice.  In addition, learners get to be creative and take chances in an emotional environment; in other words, they have the opportunity to make the target language their own.  Participants in this workshop will explore half a dozen commercial board games for their potential use in their own classrooms.

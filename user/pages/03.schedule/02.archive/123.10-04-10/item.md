Based on his Masters study with Monash University, Matthew will start by outlining some of the key differing theories in SLA. As each of the SLA theories is introduced, it will be immediately followed up by a discussion on how it can be applied in a classroom, and difficulties that might be encountered.
Matthew Jenkins has university teaching experience, runs an English school with his wife, and teaches both junior high school and elementary school children.

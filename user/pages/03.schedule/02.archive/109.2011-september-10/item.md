Since 2007, I have been stunned at my students' response to extensive writing (EWr). Their engagement and self-confidence in writing, their speed and fluency have all increased dramatically. EWr offers a chance for teachers to connect with students in an innovative, meaningful way. This workshop will provide a theoretical framework for L2 writing in an EFL context, and share results from the past 2 years of my EWr program in a Japanese high school.
Steven Herder has been teaching within the Japanese EFL context since 1989. Having extensive teaching experience at the elementary and secondary school level, he is currently an assistant professor in the International Studies department at Doshisha Women’s College of Liberal Arts. He is also extremely active in professional development within the ELT community: founding MASH Collaboration in 2007, editing numerous articles, academic volumes and proceedings, and leading teacher training seminars for various companies throughout Japan. Steven works from the perspective that, “being a teacher means a never-ending commitment to learning”.

Mark Gibson has seen and used a number of dictionaries for young learners and found that for his purposes they are usually too in-depth or don't contain enough words. Because of this he made his own. He will explain what he thinks makes a good dictionary for young learners and how to use it.
Mark Gibson has taught in Pakistan and Thailand and has his own school in Kokura.
Students at Meiji Gakuen Junior High prepare for the school’s infamous vocabulary tests by creating their own dictionaries with accent, part of speech, and Japanese definitions.  Eiki Hattori will report on his interview survey with third-year students about how to improve the usefulness of these homemade dictionaries.
Eiki Hattori, in his fifth year at Meiji, holds an MA in English Education from Hiroshima University and is interested in researching the effective teaching of writing and translation.
The tight high school curriculum doesn’t allow much instruction in dictionary use in the classroom.  However, electronic dictionaries are potentially efficient tools for students.  Go Yoshizawa will demonstrate some contrite usages of electronic dictionaries in his classes.
Go Yoshizawa, who holds an MA in TESL from Oklahoma City University and is an eleven-year veteran at Meiji, has a special interest in the linguistics of sign language.
David Latz will speak about a university vocabulary program aimed at increasing students’ vocabulary to better achieve on the TOEIC-Bridge test. The program used the Longman Eiwa-jiten dictionary, which identifies the 1000 most common spoken and written English words.  This formed the basis of weekly vocabulary tests.
David Latz is an Australian, Brisbane-born university teacher whose professional interests include pragmatics and cultural codes of conversation.

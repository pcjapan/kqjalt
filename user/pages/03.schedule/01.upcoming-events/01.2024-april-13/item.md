Our April event focuses on the use of projects outside the classroom as the foundation for English studies. We will begin with students from Malcolm Swanson’s seminar class at Seinan Jo Gakuin University sharing some of the community projects they have been engaged in. These include a Green Tourism project near Nakatsu and a collaboration with the Yaskawa historical residence in Tobata. Following that, Malcolm Swanson will discuss how projects like these are useful in building English skills in addition to a positive community spirit. We will end with a group discussion on ways to develop student projects.

**Malcolm Swanson** is a professor in the Department of English at Seinan Jo Gakuin University. His interests include the implementation of technology in the classroom and developing students’ presentation skills.

#### Please note the new date for this event - due to an unforeseen issue with the venue we are changing the date to April 20th.

Our April event focuses on the use of projects outside the classroom as the foundation for English studies. We will begin with students from Malcolm Swansonâ€™s seminar class at Seinan Jo Gakuin University sharing some of the community projects they have been engaged in. These include a Green Tourism project near Nakatsu and a collaboration with the Yaskawa historical residence in Tobata. Following that, Malcolm Swanson will discuss how projects like these are useful in building English skills in addition to a positive community spirit. We will end with a group discussion on ways to develop student projects.

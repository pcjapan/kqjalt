## Kitakyushu JALT Events Schedule Information

We hold meetings related to issues of (foreign) language teaching in Japan, usually on the second Saturday of every month.

Our events are held in or near Kokura, but check our [venue map](/location) for details. Attendance for JALT members is free, and non-members pay a mere Â¥1,000 for a one-day membership.

Most meetings feature a guest speaker, who will present on a topic relevant to language teaching. Past meetings have covered a wide range of topics, from language games to brain science and SLA. Intense discussion invariably follows!
